All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault] Lyrics
Widely regarded as one of Swift’s best songs, “All Too Well” sees her picking up shards of memories after a gut-wrenching breakup. She jumps through time to reflect on her best and worst memories with her ex,… Read More 
[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place

And I can picture it after all these days


[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more

And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street

You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me

Wind in my hair, I was there

I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed

And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the
 tee-ball team

You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town

And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now

He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame



[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do

And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath

Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest

I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here

'Cause I remember it all, all, all



[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell

Every time you double-cross my mind

You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?

A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you

Not weepin' in a party bathroom

Some actress askin' me what happened, you

That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes

Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show

But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come

And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week

'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me

You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes

""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""

From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones

I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?

Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well


[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well

Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there

It was rare, you remember it"

[Verse 1]
Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not

Penny's unlucky, I took him back

And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed


[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious (Superstitious)
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine (Ah)

Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck

A bad sign is all good, I ain't gotta knock on wood


[Chorus]

(Ah) All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star

Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood

(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark

All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood


[Post-Chorus]
Forgive me, it sounds cocky

He ah-matized me and opened my еyes

Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see

His love was thе key that opened my thighs



[Verse 2]
Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet, mm
To know a hard rock is on the way


[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious (Superstitious)
The curse on me was broken by your magic wand (Ah)

Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck

New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood),
 I ain't gotta knock on wood


[Chorus]

(Ah) All of that bitchin', wishing on a falling star

Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood

(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark

All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood


[Post-Chorus]
Forgive me, it sounds cocky

He ah-matized me and opened my eyes

Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see

His love was the key that opened my thighs

Forgive me, it sounds cocky

He ah-matized me and opened my eyes

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me

I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic

All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?


[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors

Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, but I touched you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him



[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight

I touched you, I touched you

I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

[Outro: Post Malone, Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America

Move to Florida,
 buy the car you want

But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me

Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida,
 buy the car you want

But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you"

[Verse 1]
I heard you calling on the megaphone

You wanna see me all alone

As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow


[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me

I might've drowned in the melancholy

I swore my loyalty to me (Me), myself (Myself), and I (I)
Right before you lit my sky up


[Chorus]

All that time
I sat alone in my tower

You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and

Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophеlia)


[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), thе sea (Sea), the sky

Pledge allegiance to your hands,
 your team
, your vibes

Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine

It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of

The fate of Ophelia



[Verse 2]
The eldest daughter of a nobleman

Ophelia lived in fantasy

But love was a cold bed full of scorpions
The venom stole her sanity


[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me (Come for me)

I might've lingered in purgatory

You wrap around me like a chain (A chain), a crown (A crown), a vine (A vine)

Pulling me into the fire


[Chorus]

All that time
I sat alone in my tower

You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and

Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)


[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky

Pledge allegiance to your hands,
 your team
, your vibes

Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine

It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of

The fate of Ophelia



[Bridge]
'Tis locked inside my memory
And only you possess the key

No longer drowning and deceived
All because you came for me

Locked inside my memory
And only you possess the key

No longer drowning and deceived
All because you came for me


[Chorus]

All that time
I sat alone in my tower

You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (I can see it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and

Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky

Pledge allegiance to your hands (Your hands),

Don't care where the hell you've been (You've been) 'cause now ('Cause now) you're mine

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone

High heels on cobblestones

When you are young, they assume you know nothing

Sequin smile, black lipstick

Sensual politics

When you are young, they assume you know nothing


[Chorus]
But I knew you

Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing



[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and

Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line

Once in twenty lifetimes, I


[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed

You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'


[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train

Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you
Tried to change the ending

Peter losing Wendy, I

I knew you
Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss

I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long

'Cause I knew everything when I was young

I knew I'd curse you for the longest time

Chasin' shadows in the grocery line

I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light

And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back


[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

[Intro]
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)


[Verse 1]

I saw in my mind fairy lights through the mist

I kept calm and carried the weight of the rift

Pulled him in tighter each time he was driftin' away
My spine split from carrying us up the hill

Wet through my clothes, weary bones caught the chill

I stopped tryna make him laugh, stopped tryna drill the safe


[Chorus]
Thinkin', ""How much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?""
Oh, the tragedy

So long, London
You'll find someone


[Verse 2]
I didn't opt in to be your odd man out

I founded the club she's heard great things about

I left all I knew, you left me at the house by the Heath

I stoppеd CPR, after all, it's no use
The spirit was gonе, we would never come to

And I'm pissed off you let me give you all that youth for free



[Chorus]
For so long, London
Stitches undone

Two graves, one gun

I'll find someone

[Bridge]
And you say I abandoned the ship
But I was going down with it
My white-knuckle dying grip
Holding tight to your quiet resentment

And my friends said it isn't right to be scared
Every day of a love affair
Every breath feels like rarest air
When you're not sure if he wants to be there


[Chorus]

So how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you
Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
'Fore I'd have to go be free?

[Verse 3]
You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?

I died on the altar waitin' for the proof

You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days

And I'm just getting color back into my face

I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for



[Chorus]

So (So) long (Long), London (London)
Had (Had) a (A) good (Good) run (Run)
A moment (Moment) of warm sun (Sun)
But I'm (I'm) not (Not) the (The) one (One)
So (So) long (Long), London (London)
Stitches (Stitches) undone (Undone)

Two (Two) graves (Graves) one gun (Gun)

You'll (You'll) find (Find) someone"

[Verse 1]
Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames

If we know the steps anyway?

We embroidered the memories of the time I was away

Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""

I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""

I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed

I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since


[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary

You and I go from one kiss to getting married

Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried

In your suit and tie,
 in the nick of time

You low-down boy, you stand-up guy

You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life

You said I'm the love of your life

About a million times


[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate

And told me I reformed you?

When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes

Well, you took me to hell too

And all at once, the ink bleeds

A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme

But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since



[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary

What we thought was for all time was momentary

Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried

You cinephile in black and white

All those plot twists and dynamite

Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry

You said I'm the love of your life


[Bridge]
You shit-talked me under the table

Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles

I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all

Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed

'Cause something counterfeit's dead?

It was legendary
It was momentary

It was unnecessary

Should've let it stay buried


[Chorus]
Oh, what a valiant roar

What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion

I'm combing through the braids of lies

""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind""
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire

Your arson's match, your somber eyes

And I'll still see it until I die

You're the loss of my life"

The Tortured Poets Department Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You left your typewriter at my apartment

Straight from the tortured poets department

I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""

But you're in self-sabotage mode

Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show

Who else decodes you?


[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?

And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots""

And who's gonna hold you like me?

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody

[Verse 2]
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate

We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist

I scratch your head, you fall asleep

Like a tattooed golden retriever

But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head

But I've read this one where you come undone

I chose this cyclone with you



[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
And who's gonna know you like me?
(Who's gonna know you?)
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots""

And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)

[Post-Chorus]
No-fucking-body
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
Nobody
(Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?)
Nobody

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave

And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen

Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be

'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding



[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
Car rides to Malibu

Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two

And tradin' jackets
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony

I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?


[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type

And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""

You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)



[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you

Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?


[Bridge]

Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all

And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall


[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending

You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?

You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out

I think I've seen this film before


[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy

Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me

Second, third, and hundredth chances

Balancin' on breaking branches

Those eyes add insult to injury



[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending

I'm not your problem anymore

So who am I offending now?

You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out

I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door


[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]

So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line

You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending

You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?

You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door



[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line

You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
You never gave a warning sign (All this time)
(So many signs) I never learned to read your mind

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January

And this is our place, we make the rules

And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear

Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?


[Chorus]

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Take me out and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover


[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all


[Chorus]

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?

With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue

All's well that ends well to end up with you

Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover


[Chorus]

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my

[Verse 1]

I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun

I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you

Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best

Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it

They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted


[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""

I'm havin' his baby

No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses

I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want



[Verse 2]

Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid

Tendrils tucked into a woven braid

Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all

He was chaos, he was revelry

Bedroom eyes like a remedy

Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall


[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay away from her""

The saboteurs
Protested too much

Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

[Chorus]
And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""

I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want



[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing


[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me

And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice


[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down

Went to my parents and they came around

All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over



[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and

Even my daddy just loves him

I'm his lady

And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want


[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

[Outro]
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not
But you should see your faces
But, oh my God, you should see your faces
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
(He was chaos, he was revelry)"

Down Bad Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Did you really beam me up

In a cloud of sparkling dust

Just to do experiments on?

Tell me I was the chosen one

Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from


[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I knew cosmic love


[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym

Everything comes out teenage petulance

""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""

Down bad, wakin' up in blood

Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up

Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him


[Verse 2]
Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone

In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you


[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I was heavenstruck


[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)

Everything comes out teenage petulance

""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""

Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)

Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)

Fuck it if I can't have him


[Bridge]
I loved your hostile takeovers

Encounters closer and closer

All your indecent exposures

How dare you say that it's—

I'll build you a fort on some planet

Where they can all understand it

How dare you think it's romantic

Leaving me safe and stranded

'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us

'Cause fuck it, I was in love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)

Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""

Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay


[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)

Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)

Fuck it if I can't have him

[Verse 1]
When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold

Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold

The winding road leads to the chateau

""You remind me of a younger me,"" I saw potential


[Chorus]

I'll be your father figure,
 I drink that brown liquor

I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger

This love is pure profit, just step into my office

I dry your tears with my sleeve


[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family


[Verse 2]
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain

Said, ""They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign""

I showed you all the tricks of the trade

All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé


[Chorus]

I'll be your father figure,
 I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger

This love is pure profit, just step into my office

They'll know your name in the streets


[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family

[Bridge]
I saw a change in you 
(I saw a change, saw a change in you)
My dear boy

They don't make loyalty like they used to
 (Not like they used to)
Your thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition
On foolish decisions, which led to misguided visions
That to fulfill your dreams
You had to get rid of me

I protect the family


[Chorus]

I was your father figure, we drank that brown liquor
You made a deal with this devil, turns out my dick's bigger

You want a fight? You found it, I got the place surrounded

You'll be sleeping with the fishes before you know you're drowning

Whose portrait's on the mantel?
 Who covered up your scandals?
Mistake my kindness for weakness and find your card cancelled

I was your father figure
, you pulled the wrong trigger

This empire belongs to me


[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me

[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""

I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though

I hit the ground running each night

I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made


[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know

And if you wanted me, you really should've showed

And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now


[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?

Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool

And if my wishes came true

It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone

But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

(Ooh)

[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count

You know the greatest loves of all time are over now



[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool

And if my wishes came true

It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone

But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one


[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you

If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?


[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me

In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time

But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)

With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)

I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor

You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby


[Chorus]
Was it over when she laid down on your couch?

Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?

In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights

At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight

Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs

Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings

Just to see you come runnin'

And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no


[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later

If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)

You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)

You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

Was it over when she laid down on your couch?

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night

You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price

You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below

Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes

What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

It's blue, the feeling I've got

And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)

Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true

Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)

And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""

He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

It's blue, the feeling I've got

When I picture my hometown

There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you

And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school

And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal


[Verse 2]
And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill
 each time that Aimee stompеd across my grave

And then she wrotе headlines

In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say


[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
Screamed, ""Fuck you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead

I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head


[Bridge]
I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo

But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you


[Verse 3]
And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue

I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues

And one day, your kid comes home singin'
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause


[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
And our town, it looks so small from way up here
Screamed, ""Thank you, Aimee"" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal

Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead

So I pushed each boulder up that hill
Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

'Cause you were never mine


[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you


[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine



[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better

Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all

Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""

So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no


[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time

'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine

'Cause you were never mine


[Outro]
'Cause you were never mine
Never mine

But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""

(Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car"")
(And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?)
(Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
(""Meet me behind the mall"")

Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""

And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?

Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
(For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)"

So High School Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you


[Pre-Chorus]
And in the blink of a crinklin' eye

I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights

Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me

I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time

Bittersweet sixteen suddenly


[Chorus]
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night

Your friends are around, so be quiet

I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs

'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
But look at you


[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

[Interlude]
Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me? (Kill me)

It's just a game, but really (Really)
I'm bettin' on all three (All three) for us two

Get my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)

Then pull mе to the back seat (The back sеat)

No one's ever had me (Had me), not like you


[Refrain]
Truth, dare, spin bottles

You know how to ball, I know Aristotle

Brand new, full throttle

Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto

It's true, swear, scout's honor

You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her

Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe


[Verse 2]
I feel like laughin' in the middle of practice
Do that impression you did of your dad again

I'm hearing voices like a madman


[Pre-Chorus]
And in the blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined

Cheeks pink in the twinklin' lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me

I'll drink what you think and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly

[Chorus]
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school (I feel so high school) every time I look at you
But look at you


[Refrain]
Truth, dare, spin bottles (Yeah)

You know how to ball, I know Aristotle

Brand new, full throttle (Yeah)
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto

It's true, swear, scout's honor (Yeah)
You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her

[Verse 1]
Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed

In your Jehovah's Witness suit

Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine

They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like

[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal

And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?


[Verse 2]
You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins

In public, showed me off

Then sank in stoned oblivion

'Cause once your queen had come

You'd treat her likе an also-ran

You didn't measure up
In any measurе of a man



[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Bridge]
Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?

In fifty years, will all this be declassified?

And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, ""Good riddance""
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden

I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside

And you deserve prison
, but you won't get time

You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars

You crashed my party and your rental car

You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing


[Outro]
And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did

And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive

The smallest man who ever lived"

[Verse 1]

Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes

Sad as it seems, apathy is hot

Everybody's cutthroat in the comments

Every single hot take is cold as ice

When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie


[Pre-Chorus]
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness

I've been dying just from trying to seem cool


[Chorus]
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage

But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out

So many traitors

Smooth operators

But I'm never gonna break that vow

I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now

[Verse 2]
You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine

That was the night I fell off and broke my arm

Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion

When your first crush crushes something kind

When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie



[Pre-Chorus]
Every eldest daughter was the first lamb to the slaughter

So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire


[Chorus]
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage

But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out

So many traitors

Smooth operators

But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now


[Bridge]
We lie back
A beautiful, beautiful time-lapse
Ferris wheels, kisses, and lilacs
And things I said were dumb
'Cause I thought that I'd never find that
Beautiful, beautiful life that
Shimmers that innocent light back
Like when we were young


[Pre-Chorus]
Every youngest child felt
They were raised up in the wild
But now you're home



[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage

And I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors

Smooth operators

But I'm never gonna break that vow (Never gonna break that vow)
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

Never gonna break that vow (Oh)
I'm never gonna leave you now, now
I'm never gonna leave you now"

[Verse 1]
Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while

My boredom's bone-deep

This cage was once just fine

Am I allowed to cry?

I dream of crackin' locks

Throwin' my life to the wolves
 or the ocean rocks

Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox

I'm seeing visions

Am I bad or mad or wise?


[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine""
 on my upper thigh
 only in my mind?

One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze

Oh, what a way to die

I keep recalling things we never did

Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts

Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?


[Verse 2]
I keep these longings lockеd

In lowercase, inside a vault

Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""

These fatal fantasies

Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me

We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe

Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?



[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?

One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze

Oh, what a way to die

My bed sheets are ablaze

I've screamed his name

Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave

Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?


[Bridge]
What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway

What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?

If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me

They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly

I choose you and me religiously


[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?

One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die

I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

He sent me ""Downtown Lights""

I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed

I sit and watch you

I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait

Lay the table with the fancy shit

And watch you tolerate it

If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow

I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

While you were out buildin' other worlds, where was I?

Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?

I made you my temple, my mural, my sky

Now I'm beggin' for footnotes in the story of your life

Drawin' hearts in the byline

Always takin' up too much space or time

You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)

Break free and leave us in ruins?
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it

You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing

Crestfallen on the landing

Champagne problems

Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet

Your heart was glass, I dropped it

Champagne problems


[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle

Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it

No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it

Champagne problems

You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason

Champagne problems

Your Midas touch on the Chevy door

November flush and your flannel cure

""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""

How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again

And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through

One for the money, two for the show

I never was ready so I watch you go

Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you

""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said

But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems

Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet

You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser

Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room


[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis

(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me

At teatime, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed



[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

(A tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

At teatime, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me

The Alchemy Lyrics
[Verse 1]
This happens once every few lifetimes

These chemicals hit me like white wine

What if I told you I'm back?
The hospital was a drag

Worst sleep that I ever had
I circled you on a map

I haven't come around in so long
But I'm coming back so strong


[Chorus]
So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team

Ditch the clowns, get the crown

Baby, I'm the one to beat

'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight thе alchemy?


[Verse 2]
Hey, you, what if I told you we'rе cool?

That child's play back in school
Is forgiven under my rule

I haven't come around in so long
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong



[Chorus]
So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team

Ditch the clowns, get the crown

Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
These blokes warm the benches
We've been on a winning streak

He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an ""E""

'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?


[Bridge]
Shirts off and your friends lift you up over their heads
Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
""There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league""

Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me


[Chorus]
Touchdown
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team

Ditch the clowns, get the crown

Baby, I'm the one to beat

'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
These blokes warm the benches

We've been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an ""E""
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things

Magic, madness, heaven, sin

Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face

You look like my next mistake

Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine

Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends

Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend


[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

'Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name



[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month

Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns

Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream


[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name



[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya


[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)

'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (And you love the game)
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"

[Verse 1]
The who's who of ""Who's that?"" is poised for the attack

But my bare hands paved their paths

You don't get to tell me about ""sad""


[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive


[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street

Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream

""Who's afraid of little old me?""

You should be

[Verse 2]
The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name

You don't get to tell me you feel bad


[Pre-Chorus]
Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one morе joke

Then we could all just laugh until I cry


[Chorus]
So I lеap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""

I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean

""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""

Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be


[Post-Chorus]
(You should be) You should be
(You should be) You should be
You should be (You should be)
You should be (You should be)
You should be

[Bridge]
So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?

Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me

So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs

I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?

That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn

That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong

Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singin' along


[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean

""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""

Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be


[Post-Chorus]
(You should be) You should be
(You should be) You should be
'Cause you lured me (You should be)
And you hurt me (You should be)
And you taught me

[Outro]
You caged me and then you called me crazy

I am what I am 'cause you trained me
So who's afraid of me?
Who's afraid of little old me?
Who's afraid of little old me?"

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me

Betty, one time, I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe


[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez

You can't believe a word she says

Most times, but this time, it was true

The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?

Would you tell me to go fuck myself

Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him



[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez

You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]

But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones

Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said, ""James, get in, let's drive""

Those days turned into nights

Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long



[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep

And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time

I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]

Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch

In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?

Will it patch your broken wings?

I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight

You know I miss you"

The Life of a Showgirl Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]

Her name was Kitty
Made her money being pretty and witty
They gave her the keys to this city
Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
I bought a ticket
She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
Looking back, I guess it was kismet


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I waited by the stage door, packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name,
 then glowing like the end of a cigarette

Wow, she came out
I said, ""You're living my drеam""

Then she said to me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]

""Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten
So you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna""



[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]

She was a menace
The baby of the family in Lenox

Her father whored around like all men did

Her mother took pills and played tennis


[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
So she waited by the stage door as the club promoter arrived
She said, ""I'd sell my soul to have a taste of a magnificent life that's all mine""

But that's not what showgirls get
They leave us for dead


[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Sabrina Carpenter & Taylor Swift]

Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten
So you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna


[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]

I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck

I paid my dues with every bruise, I knew what to expect

Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins?

They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away

And all the headshots on the walls
Of the dance hall are of the bitches

Who wish I'd hurry up and die
But I'm immortal now, baby dolls
I couldn't if I tried

So I say


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]

""Thank you for the lovely bouquet
I'm married to the hustle

And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
And I'll never know another

Pain hidden by the lipstick and lace (Lipstick and lace)

Sequins are forever

And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
Wouldn't have it any other way"" (Wouldn't have it any other way)

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Oh, wouldn't have it any other way
(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Hey, Kitty
(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Now I make my money being pretty and witty
Thank you for the lovely bouquet


[Outro: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]

Thank you for an unforgettable night
We will see you next time
Give it up for the band
And the dancers
And of course, Sabrina
I love you, Taylor
That's our show, we love you so much
Good night"

[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him

Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some

Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothin' better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta


[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?


[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealin' hearts and runnin' off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist and
We'll move to an island and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor

Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

I, I, I see how this is gon' go (Go)
Touch me and you'll never be alone

My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Oh, here we go again
The voices in his head
Called the rain to end our days of wild

The sickest army doll

Purchased at the mall

Rivulets descend my plastic smile


[Pre-Chorus]
But you should've seen him when he first got me

[Chorus]
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh

'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night

I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh


[Verse 2]
There was a litany of reasons why
We could've playеd for keeps this time
I know I'm just repeating mysеlf

Put me back on my shelf
But first, pull the string

And I'll tell you that he runs
Because he loves me (He loves me)



[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me


[Chorus]
My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen (I'm queen), of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh

'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh

My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh


[Bridge]
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Once I fix me
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) He's gonna miss me
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) Once I fix me
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) He's gonna miss me

[Outro]
Just say when, I'd play again
He was my best friend down at the sandlot
I felt more when we played pretend

Than with all the Kens

'Cause he took me out of my box
Stole my tortured heart

Left all these broken parts
Told me I'm better off
But I'm not
I'm not, I'm not"

Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard

Clink, clink, being this young is art

Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool
What if all I need is you?


[Pre-Chorus]
Got love-struck, went straight to my head

Got lovesick all over my bed

Love to think you’ll never forget
Handprints in wet cement

Adorned with smoke on my clothes

Lovelorn and nobody knows

Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't


[Chorus]
But if I’m all dressed up

They might as well be lookin' at us
And if they call me a slut

You know it might be worth it for once

And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love


[Verse 2]

Send the code, he's waitin' there

The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air

Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time

And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman



[Pre-Chorus]
Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)
Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)

Love to think you’ll never forget

We’ll pay the price, I guess

But if I'm all dressed up (If I’m all dressed up)

They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)
And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)

You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love


[Bridge]
Half asleep
Takin’ your time in the tangerine
Neon light, this is luxury

You're not sayin' you're in love with me

But you're goin' to
Half awake

Takin' your chance, it's a big mistake

I said, ""It might blow up in your pretty face""
I'm not sayin', ""Do it anyway"" (Do it anyway)
But you're going to

And if they call me a (Slut)

You know it might be worth it for once

[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)

Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever


[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

You thought that it would be okay, at first
The situation could be saved, of course
But they'd already picked out your grave and hearse

Beware the wrath of masked crusaders


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you girlboss too close to the sun?

Did they catch you having far too much fun?

Come with me, when they see us, they'll run
Something wicked this way comes


[Chorus]

Good thing I like my friends cancelled

I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour,
 and poison thorny flowers

Welcome to my underworld where it gets quite dark

At least you know exactly who your friends are

They're the ones with matching scars


[Verse 2]
It's easy to love you when you're popular

The optics click, everyone prospers

But one single drop, you're off the roster

""Tone-deaf and hot, let's fucking off her""



[Pre-Chorus]
Did you make a joke only a man could?

Were you just too smug for your own good?

Or bring a tiny violin to a knife fight?

Baby, that all ends tonight

Good thing I like my friends cancelled (Cancelled)

I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal (Yeah)
Like my whiskey sour,
 and poison thorny flowers

(Honey)
 Welcome to my underworld, it'll break your heart
At least you know exactly who your friends are

They're the ones with matching scars


[Bridge]
They stood by me before my exoneration
They believed I was innocent
So I'm not here for judgment, no


[Verse 3]
But if you can't be good, then just be better at it
Everyone's got bodies in the attic
Or took somebody's man, we'll take you by the hand
And soon, you'll learn the art of never getting caught


[Chorus]
It's a good thing I like my friends cancelled

(You know that) I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
I like my whiskey sour,
 and poison thorny flowers (Ooh)

Yeah, it's a good thing I like my friends cancelled (Cancelled)

I salute you if you're much too much to handle

Like my whiskey sour (I like it),
 and poison thorny flowers (I love it)

Can't you see my infamy loves company?

Now they've broken you like they've broken me
But a shattered glass is a lot more sharp

And now you know exactly who your friends are (You know who we are)

We're the ones with matching scars"

Know exactly where it leads, but I

Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time


[Pre-Chorus]
Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?

I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes

Mendin' all her gashes

You might just have dealt the final blow


[Chorus]
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse

My heart won't start anymore for you

'Cause you're losin' me


[Verse 2]
Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes

How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick

My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick



[Pre-Chorus]
And the air is thick with loss and indecision

I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're runnin' down the hallway
And you know what they all say
""You don't know what you got until it's gone""


[Chorus]
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse

My heart won't start anymore for you

'Cause you're losin' me
'Cause you're losin' me
Stop (Stop) 'cause you're losin' me


[Post-Chorus]
My heart won't start anymore

(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)

My heart won't start anymore

(Stop 'cause you're losin' me)


[Bridge]
How long could we be a sad song
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?

I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy

And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier

Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me

I'm the best thing at this party (You're losin' me)
And I wouldn't marry me either

A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her

And I'm fadin', thinkin'
""Do something, babe, say something"" (Say something)
""Lose something, babe, risk something"" (You're losin' me)
""Choose something, babe, I got nothing"" (I got nothing)
""To believe, unless you're choosin' me""



[Outro]
You're losin' me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me
Stop (Stop, stop), you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse

My heart won't start anymore"

[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room

And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too

Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?

'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day


[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace

And you're the hero flying around, saving face

And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?

Cursing my name, wishing I stayed

Look at how my tears ricochet


[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean

Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene

You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace

'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave

And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed

Look at how my tears ricochet



[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home

And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones

And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)

And when you can't sleep at night
 (You hear my stolen lullabies)


[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves

You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same

Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years

And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed

Look at how my tears ricochet"

[Verse 1]
I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it

""Eating out of the trash""
It's never gonna last

I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts

And all the perfect couples
Said, ""When you know, you know""
And, ""When you don't, you don't""


[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)

Have seen it before, they'll see it again (Ha, ha)
Life is a song, it ends when it ends

I was wrong

[Chorus]

But my mama told me, ""It's alright

You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never met no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""



[Verse 2]
You couldn't understand it
Why you felt alone
You were in it for real
She was in her phone
And you were just a pose

And don't we try to love love? (Love, love)
We give it all we got (Give it all we got)

You finally left the table (Uh, uh)

And what a simple thought
You're starving 'til you're not


[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)

Have messed up before, they'll mess up again
 (Ha, ha)
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
You move on

[Chorus]

And that's when I told you, ""It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never met no one like you before
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""



[Bridge]
This is just
A storm inside a teacup

But shelter here with me, my love
Thunder like a drum

This life will beat you up, up, up, up
This is just
A temporary speed bump
But failure brings you freedom
And I can bring you love, love, love, love (Love)


[Chorus]

Don't you sweat it, baby, it's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Oh, so sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you before (No)
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

[Intro]
Elizabeth Taylor

Do you think it's forever?


[Verse 1]
That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza Athénée

Ooh-ooh, oftentimes it doesn't feel so glamorous to be me

All the right guys promised they'd stay

Under bright lights, they withered away
But you bloom

Portofino was on my mind (And I think you know why)


[Pre-Chorus]
And if your letters ever said, ""Goodbye""


[Chorus]

I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor

Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?

Been number one, but I never had two

And I can't have fun if I can't have— (Uh)
Be my NY whеn Hollywood hates me

You're only as hot as your last hit, baby

Been numbеr one, but I never had two

And I can't have fun if I can't have you


[Verse 2]
Hey-ey, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?

Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust
 (Just kidding)

We hit the best booth
 at Musso and Frank's

They say I'm bad news, I just say, ""Thanks""

And you
Look at me like you're hypnotized, and I think you know why



[Pre-Chorus]
And if you ever leave me high and dry


[Chorus]

I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor

Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?

Been number one, but I never had two

And I can't have fun if I can't have— (Uh)
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me

You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have (Uh) you

[Post-Chorus]
Elizabeth Taylor (Oh)

Do you think it's forever? (Oh)
If I can't have you

[Bridge]
(Ah) All my white diamonds
 and lovers are forever

(Ah) In the papers, on the screen, and in their minds

(Ah) All my white diamonds
 and lovers are forever

(Ah) Don't you ever end up anything but mine


[Chorus]

I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor

Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?

Been number one, but I never had two

And I can't have fun if I can't have— (You)
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me

You're only as hot as your last hit, baby

Been number one, but I never had two

And I can't have fun if I can't have— (You)


[Outro]
All my white diamonds
 and lovers are forever
 (Elizabeth Taylor)

(Do you think it's forever?)
 In the papers, on the screen, and in their minds

All my white diamonds
 and lovers are forever

Don't you ever end up anything but mine, oh"

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too

They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true

And my friends all smell like weed or little babies

And this city reeks of driving myself crazy


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Little did you know your home's really only
A town you're just a guest in

So you work your life away just to pay
For a time-share
 down in Destin

Florida
Is one hell of a drug
Florida
Can I use you up?


[Verse 2: Florence Welch, Taylor Swift & Florence Welch]
The hurricane with my name when it came
I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away

Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine

Well, me and my ghosts, wе had a hell of a time
Yes, I'm hauntеd, but I'm feeling just fine

All my girls got their lace and their crimes
And your cheating husband disappeared, well
No one asks any questions here

So I did my best to lay to rest
All of the bodies that have ever been on my body

And in my mind, they sink into the swamp

Is that a bad thing to say in a song?



[Pre-Chorus: Florence Welch]
Little did you know your home's really only
The town you'll get arrested
So you pack your life away just to wait out
The shitstorm back in Texas

Florida
Is one hell of a drug
Florida

I need to forget, so take me to Florida
I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
At least the dolls are beautiful
, fuck me up, Florida
I need to forget, so take me to Florida
I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida

It's one hell of a drug
It's one hell of a drug
Love left me like this and I don't want to exist
So take me to Florida

Little did you know your home's really only
A town you're just a guest in (Florida)
So you work your life away just to pay
For a time-share down in Destin

[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like

And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town

I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door

All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams

Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door

All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?

[Verse 1]
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays

I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me

It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days


[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes

I waited ages to see you there

I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared


[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been


[Verse 2]
I see the great escape,
 so long, Daisy May

I picked the petals, he loves me not

Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away



[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there

I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare


[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been


[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]

From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this

I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss

The jokes weren't funny
, I took the money

My friends from home don't know what to say

I looked around in a blood-soaked gown

And I saw something they can't take away

'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned

Everything you lose is a step you take

So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid



[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been"

Your smile (Mm, mm)
Miles wide

And it was not an invitation
Should've kissed you anyway
Should've kissed you anyway
And it was not convenient, no
But your girlfriend was away
Should've kissed you anyway, hey

Shiny wood floors underneath my feet
Disco ball makes everything look cheap

Wilted corsage dangles from my wrist

Over his shoulder, I catch a glimpse
And see (Mm, mm)
You looking at mе

Don't make it awkward in second period
Might piss your ex off, lately, we've been good
Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should

Don't make it awkward in second period
Might piss your ex off, lately, we've been good
Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should

When I left school, I lost track of you
Abigail called me with the bad news

Goodbye
And we'll never know why


[Chorus]
It was not an invitation
But I flew home anyway
With so much left to say
It was not convenient, no

But I whispered at the grave
""Should've kissed you anyway,"" ooh

And it was not (It was not) an invitation (Invitation)
Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway)
Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway), anyway
And it was not—

Better that than regret it for all time

Should've kissed you anyway

And my advice is always answer the question
Better that than to ask it all your life

I wanna be your first string (First string)

I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)

Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older

Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders

Reputation precedes me, in rumours, I'm knee-deep

The truth is, it’s easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song

For all your beautiful traits and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, somethin' was born on the 4th of July

Our past days were the fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it

Big reputation, big reputation (Big reputation, yeah)

Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too



[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em

Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy

I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me

And I can't let you go, your handprints on my soul

It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold

You've been callin' my bluff on all my usual tricks

So here's the truth from my red lips (Ooh, ah)

I wanna be your first string (Me and you; First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (Hey; Be your A-Team now; A-Team)

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew

So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh



[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

[Chorus]
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

[Verse 1]
They want that yacht life, under chopper blades

They want those bright lights and Balenci' shades

And a fat ass with a baby face

They want it all
They want that complex female character

They want that critical smash Palme d'Or
And an Oscar on their bathroom floor

They want it all

[Pre-Chorus]
And they should have what they want
They deserve what they want
Hope they get what they want


[Chorus]

I just want you, huh

Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you

We tell the world to leave us thе fuck alone, and they do, wow

Got me drеaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop

Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)

I just want you

[Verse 2]
They want that freedom, living off the grid

They want those three dogs that they call their kids

And that good surf
, no hypocrites

They want it all
They want a contract with Real Madrid

They want that spring break that was fucking lit
And then that video taken off the internet

They want it all


[Pre-Chorus]
And they should have what they want
They deserve what they want
I hope they get what they want

[Chorus]

I just want you (You, you, yeah), huh
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do (Ooh), wow

Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop (Hoop)

Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)


[Bridge]
I made wishes on all of the stars
Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot

I thought I had it right, once, twice, but I did not (I did not)
You caught me off my guard

I hope I get what I want (Get what I want)
'Cause I know what I want

[Chorus]

(I just, I just) I just want you, huh (Baby)
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like (Got 'em lookin' like you) you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop

Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)

I just want you (Ooh)
And we could have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like (You) you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do (Yeah), wow

Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife

And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face

Lost in your current like a priceless wine


[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow

I'm begging for you to take my hand

Wreck my plans, that's my man


[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win


[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow

I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home

Anywhere else is hollow

I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man



[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

But I come back stronger than a '90s trend


[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark

Show me the places where the others gave you scars

Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art


[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow

I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow

I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home

Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man



[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

Fresh Out The Slammer Lyrics
[Intro]

Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you

Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to

(Fresh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 1]
Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder

He don't understand me

Splintered back in winter
, silent dinners, bitter

He was with her in dreams


[Pre-Chorus]
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels

Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine

Years of labor, locks, and ceilings

In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time


[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you

Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 2]
Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge

As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again


[Pre-Chorus]
My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
Watch me daily disappearing
For just one glimpse of his smile

All those nights, he kept me goin'
Swirled you into all of my poems

Now we're at the starting line, I did my time


[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'


[Bridge]
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)

To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams

And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here

At the park where we used to sit on children's swings

Wearing imaginary rings

But it's gonna be alright, I did my time"

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 a.m.
 
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out

And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression

But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun

And snakes and stones never broke my bones


[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down


[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)

Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night



[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace

And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay


[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?

You need to calm down


[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns

You need to calm down


[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down"

[Verse 1]
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park

I used to think I would meet somebody there

Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money


[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs

Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA

You ate at my favorite spot for dinner

Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer



[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine

Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar

Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire

Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons

One single thread of gold
Tied me to you


[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents

Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park

Hell was the journey, but it brought me heaven



[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool, baby, with me

And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?

[Verse 1]
When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again

Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend

""How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?"" you say
""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how""

I see you every day now


[Chorus]
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes

Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me

And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon


[Verse 2]
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?

You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway

Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us

I feel you, no matter what

The rubies that I gave up



[Chorus]
And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes

Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me

And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon


[Bridge]
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave


[Chorus]
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me

And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days


[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more

And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street

You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me

Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well


[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed

And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team

You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me



[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


[Chorus]

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah


[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest

I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well



[Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all

I promise that you'll never find another like me

I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump

And you're the kinda guy the ladies want

(And there's a lotta cool chicks out there)

I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone

And trouble's gonna follow where I go

(And there's a lotta cool chicks out there)

But one of these things is not like the others

Like a rainbow with all of the colors

Baby doll, when it comes to a lover

I promise that you'll never find another like

I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

I know I tend to make it about me

I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lotta lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name

I never wanna see you walk away

(And there's a lotta lame guys out there)

'Cause one of these things is not like the others

Livin' in winter, I am your summer

Uh-uh, uh-uh

Feet in the swing over the creek

With Pennsylvania under me

Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer

Cross your heart, won't tell no other

And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you

Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn

Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long


[Bridge]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why

And I think you should come live with me

And we can be pirates

Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet

And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on



[Verse 2]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted

I, I

Sweet tea in the summer

Cross my heart, won’t tell no other

And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you

Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever

Our love lasts so long"

[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny

Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis

Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes

They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""

Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud

The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out


[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been

There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen

She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city

Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names

And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí



[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty

Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen

She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green

Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach

Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

Clara Bow Lyrics
[Verse 1]
""You look like Clara Bow

In this light, remarkable
All your life, did you know

You'd be picked like a rose?""


[Pre-Chorus]
""I'm not trying to exaggerate
But I think I might die if it happened

Die if it happened to me
No one in my small town
Thought I'd see the lights of Manhattan""


[Chorus]
""This town is fake, but you're the rea
l thing

Breath of fresh air through smoke rings

Take the glory, give everything

Promise to be dazzling""


[Verse 2]

""You look like Stevie Nicks
In '75, the hair and lips

Crowd goes wild at her fingertips

Half moonshine, a full еclipse""


[Pre-Chorus]
""I'm not trying to exaggeratе
But I think I might die if I made it, die if I made it

No one in my small town thought I'd meet these suits in L.A.

They all wanna say...""



[Chorus]
""This town is fake, but you're the real thing

Breath of fresh air through smoke rings

Take the glory, give everything

Promise to be dazzling

The crown is stained, but you're the real queen

Flesh and blood amongst war machines

You're the new god we're worshipping

Promise to be dazzling""


[Bridge]

Beauty is a beast that roars down on all fours
Demanding more

Only when your girlish glow flickers just so

Do they let you know
It's hell on earth to be heavenly

Them's the breaks, they don't come gently


[Outro]

""You look like Taylor Swift

In this light, we're lovin' it

You've got edge, she never did

The future's bright, dazzling

[Verse 1]
Honey, when I'm above the trees

I see this for what it is

But now I'm right down in it, all the years I've given
Is just shit we're dividin' up
Showed you all of my hiding spots

I was dancing when the music stopped

And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention
I haven't met the new me yet


[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true

There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes

That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness


[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?

When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?

I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that

Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury

You haven't met the new me yet



[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide

There is a glorious sunrise

Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind

And there is happiness

[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain

I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven

And I pulled your body into mine
Every goddamn night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too


[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees

I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head

After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that

All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness

You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that



[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind

Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness"

[Verse 1]

I've been having a hard time adjusting

I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting

I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that

Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down

And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway


[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


[Verse 2]

They told me all of my cages were mental

So I got wasted like all my potential

And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad

I have a lot of regrets about that

I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere

Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here

Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey


[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying



[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying


[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you

You're a flashback in a film reel
 on the one screen in my town


[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down

Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return

Take the road less traveled by

Tell yourself you can always stop

What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots


[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares

It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times


[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist

Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high

A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times



[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares

They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times


[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""

Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else

Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else


[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself

[Verse 1]
You went to a party
I heard from everybody
You part the crowd like the Red Sea

Don't even get me started
Did you get anxious though
On the way home?
I guess I'll never, ever know
Now that we don't talk


[Verse 2]
You grew your hair long

You got new icons

And from the outside
It looks like you're tryin' lives on
I miss the old ways

You didn't have to change
But I guess I don't have a say
Now that we don't talk

[Chorus]
I call my mom, she said that it was for the best

Remind myself, the morе I gave, you'd want me less

I cannot bе your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost
And what it cost, now that we don't talk



[Bridge]
What do you tell your friends we
Shared dinners, long weekends with?

Truth is, I can't pretend it's
Platonic, it's just ended, so


[Chorus]
I call my mom, she said to get it off my chest (Off my chest)

Remind myself the way you faded 'til I left ('Til I left)
I cannot be your friend, so I pay the price of what I lost (Of what I lost)
And what it cost, now that we don't talk


[Outro]
I don't have to pretend I like acid rock

Or that I'd like to be on a mega yacht

With important men who think important thoughts

Guess maybe I am better off now that we don't talk
And the only way back to my dignity
Was to turn into a shrouded mystery

Just like I had been when you were chasing me
Guess this is how it has to be now that we don't talk"

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me

We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?

But you can make me a drink

Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back

Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you

Oh, damn, never seen that color blue

Just think of the fun things we could do

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so

Third floor on the West Side, me and you

Handsome, you're a mansion with a view

Do the girls back home touch you like I do?

Long night with your hands up in my hair

Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me

They took the crown, but it's alright

All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months

'Cause

My baby's fit like a daydream

Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to

Loves me like I'm brand new

Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm

All the drama queens taking swings

All the jokers dressing up as kings

They fade to nothing when I look at him

And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right

I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers

Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right

Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

Walkin' with his head down

Loves me like I'm brand new

I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck

Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I

I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
""You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?""
Yes (Would you run away?)

My baby's fit like a daydream

Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to

So call it what you want, yeah (Call it what you want it to)

I am someone who until recent events
You shared your secrets with

And your location, you forgot to turn it off

And so I watch as you walk

Into some bar called The Black Dog

And pierce new holes in my heart

You forgot to turn it off

And it hits me

[Chorus]
I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in The Black Dog
When someone plays ""The Starting Line""

And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song

That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming

Old habits die screaming


[Verse 2]
I move through the world with the heartbroken

My longings stay unspoken

And I may never open up thе way I did for you

And all of those best laid plans

You said I needed a bravе man

Then proceeded to play him

Until I believed it too

And it kills me


[Chorus]

I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in the shower
And remember how my rain-soaked body

Was shakin', do you hate me?

Was it hazing? For a cruel fraternity

I pledged and I still mean it

Old habits die screaming


[Bridge]
Six weeks of breathin' clean air
I still miss the smoke

Were you makin' fun of me
With some esoteric joke?

Now I wanna sell my house

And set fire to all my clothes

And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
Even if I die screaming

And I hope you hear it


[Chorus]

And I hope it's shitty in
 The Black Dog

When someone plays ""The Starting Line""

And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming

I Hate It Here Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Quick, quick, tell me something awful
Like you are a poet
 trapped inside the body of a finance guy

Tell me all your secrets, all you'll ever be is
My eternal consolation prize

You see, I was a debutante in another life, but
Now I seem to be scared to go outside

If comfort is a construct, I don't believe in good luck

Now that I know what's what

[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind

People need a key to get to, the only one is mine

I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child

No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears

I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

[Verse 2]

My friends used to play a game where
We would pick a decade
We wished we could live in instead of this
I'd say the 1830s but without all the racists

And getting married off for the highest bid

Everyone would look down 'cause it wasn't fun now

Seems like it was never even fun back then
Nostalgia is a mind's trick

If I'd been there, I'd hate it

It was freezing in the palace


[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to lunar valleys in my mind

When they found a better planet, only the gentle survived

I dreamed about it in the dark, the night I felt like I might die

No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

[Bridge]
I'm lonely, but I'm good
I'm bitter, but I swear I'm fine

I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on purpose

This place made me feel worthless

Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me

And in my fantasies, I rise above it

And way up there, I actually love it


[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to secret gardens in my mind

People need a key to get to, the only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child

No mid-sized city hopes and small-town fears
I'm there most of the year 'cause I hate it here
I hate it here

How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones

In a faith-forgotten land

In from the snow

Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand


[Pre-Chorus]
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living


[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another

Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you


[Verse 2]
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed

He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see

He wants what's only yours

Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another

Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland

[Verse 3]
Clover blooms in the fields

Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear

Spring breaks loose, but so does fear

He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine


[Chorus]
Oh, goddamn
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another

Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you



[Bridge]
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a goddamn blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the goddamn fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows

In you, in you
Now I'm covered in you

Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices

We had one thing goin' on
I swear that it was somethin'

'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since

But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I

Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations

[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room

And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you

But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh

When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question


[Verse 2]
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night

But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles

And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray

I just may like to have a conversation

[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room

And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you

But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

[Bridge]
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?

That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight


[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)

And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you)

But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do? (Do)
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh (More of a fight)
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?

[Verse 1]
If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?

And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've

If you'd never looked my way

[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen

And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts

Memories feel like weapons

And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering


[Verse 2]
If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was

But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us



[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith

Would've, could've, should've

If I'd only played it safe

[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen

And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts

Memories feel like weapons

And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering


[Bridge]
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close

Stained glass windows in my mind

I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close

I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time


[Verse 3]
If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?

Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts

Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first


[Chorus]
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen

And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts

Memories feel like weapons

And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering


[Outro]
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
Oh, God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time"

[Verse 1]
The smoke cloud billows out his mouth
Like a freight train through a small town

The jokes that he told across the bar
Were revolting and far too loud


[Chorus]
They shake their heads sayin', ""God, help her""
When I tell 'em he's my man

But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger

I can fix him, no, really, I can
And only I can


[Verse 2]
The dopamine races through his brain
On a six-lane Texas highway

His hand so calloused from his pistol
Softly traces hearts on my face

And I could see it from a mile away
A perfect case for my certain skill set

He had a halo of the highest gradе
He just hadn't met me yеt


[Chorus]
They shake their heads sayin', ""God, help her""
When I tell 'em he's my man

But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger

I can fix him, no, really, I can
And only I can

Good boy, that's right, come close

I'll show you Heaven if you'll be an angel, all night
Trust me, I can handle me a dangerous man
No, really, I can


[Chorus]

They shook their heads sayin', ""God, help her""
When I told 'em he's my man (I told 'em he's my man)

But your good Lord didn't need to lift a finger

I can fix him, no, really, I can (No, really, I can)
Woah, maybe I can't"

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me

Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did

And my flight was awful, thanks for asking

I'm unglued, thanks to you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around


[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey]
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah



[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]

This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen

I searched ""aurora borealis green""

I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest

And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
I (I) can't (Can't) speak, afraid to jinx it
I (I) don't (Don't) even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet

Now I'm all for you like Janet

Can this be a real thing? Can it?


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey, Taylor Swift]
Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream (Flying in a dream)
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me (You wanting me)
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach (Flying in a dream)

No sound, it's all around

I've known it from the very start
We’re a shot in the darkest dark

Oh no, oh no, I'm unarmed

The waiting is a sadness

Fading into madness

Oh no, oh no, it won't stop

I’m standin' on a tightrope alone

I hold my breath a little bit longer

Halfway out the door, but it won't close
I'm holdin' out hope for you to

'Cause you kiss mе and it stops time

And I'm yours, but you're not mine

Oh no, oh no, you're not there

I wait for you to drive by

I'm tryna see the cards that you won't show

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned

You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time


[Pre-Chorus]
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse

Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?

And the first night that you saw me

Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line

What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine

It was all by dеsign

'Cause I'm a mastermind

[Verse 2]
You see, all the wisеst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game



[Pre-Chorus]
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail

Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?

And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design

'Cause I'm a mastermind


[Bridge]

No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless

This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian

'Cause I care


[Chorus]
So I told you none of it was accidental

And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time

You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind"

Gray November
I've been down since July

Motion capture
Put me in a bad light
I replay my footsteps on each stepping stone
Trying to find the one where I went wrong

Writing letters
Addressed to the fire


[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catchin' my breath
Starin' out an open window, catchin' my death

And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Hey, December
Guess I'm feeling unmoored
Can't remember
What I used to fight for

I rewind thе tape, but all it does is pause

On thе very moment all was lost
Sending signals

To be double-crossed



[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I was catchin' my breath
Barefoot in the wildest winter, catchin' my death

And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
That this pain would be for
Evermore

(Evermore)


[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift]

Can't not think of all the cost
And the things that will be lost
Oh, can we just get a pause?
To be certain we'll be tall again

Whether weather be the frost
Or the violence of the dog days

I'm on waves, out being tossed
Is there a line that I could just go cross?

And when I was shipwrecked (Can't think of all the cost now)

I thought of you
 (All the things that will be lost now)
In the cracks of light (Can we just get a pause?)
I dreamed of you
 (To be certain we'll be tall again)
(If you think of all the cost)
It was real enough (Whether weather be the frost)
To get me through (Or the violence of the dog days)
(Or the violence of the dog days)
(Out on waves, being tossed)
(I'm on waves, out being tossed)
But I swear (Is there a line that we can just go cross?)
You were there

And I was catchin' my breath
Floors of a cabin creakin' under my step

And I couldn't be sure
I had a feeling so peculiar
This pain wouldn't be for

I want you to know

I'll show you every version of yourself tonight

I'll get you out on the floor

Shimmering beautiful

And when I break, it's in a million pieces


[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear

You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

Hush, I know they said the end is near

But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you


[Verse 2]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball
I can change everything about me to fit in

You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten

Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

Hush, I know they said the end is near

Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you


[Bridge]
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down

When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns

I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me

And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why

I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try

I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me

I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street

Like waiting for a bus that never shows

You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different
It hits different this time

Movin' on was always easy for me to do

Rip the band-aid off and skip town likе an asshole outlaw

Freedom felt like summеr then on the coast

Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings

And I never don't cry (And I never don't cry) at the bar

Yeah, my sadness is contagious (My sadness is contagious)

I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car

I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed

I trace the evidence, make it make some sense

Why the wound is still bleedin'

You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes

This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy

Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief

In the good in the world, you once believed in me

And I felt you and I held you for a while

Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl



[Verse 3]
I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away

Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different (It hits different)
It hits different this time

My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in

Everyone looked worse in the light

There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven

I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye


[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night

And now I see daylight, I only see daylight


[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke


[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down

Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town

Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night

(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (Daylight), I only see daylight (Daylight)


[Post-Chorus]
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

And I can still see it all (In my mind)
All of you, all of me (Intertwined)

I once believed love would be (Black and white)

But it's golden (Golden)
And I can still see it all (In my head)

Back and forth from New York (Sneakin' in your bed)

I once believed love would be (Burnin' red)
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, daylight


[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
And I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things will never be the same)
I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night

(Now I'm wide awake)
And now I see daylight (I see daylight), I only see daylight (Ah)

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight (Ah)
(And I can still see it all)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
(And I can still see it all, back and forth from New York)
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

(I once believed love would be burning red)



[Outro]
Like daylight
It's golden like daylight

You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go


[Spoken Outro]

I wanna be defined by the things that I love

Not the things I hate
Not the things I'm afraid of, I'm afraid of
Or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night

I, I just think that
You are what you love"

Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
You forgive, you forget, but you never let it go

Honey Lyrics
[Intro]
You can call me ""honey"" if you want because I'm the one you want

Mm, mm

[Chorus]
When anyone called me ""sweetheart""
It was passive-aggressive at the bar

And the bitch was telling me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong

If anyone called me ""honey""
It was standing in the bathroom, white teeth
They were saying that skirt don't fit me

And I cried the whole way home


[Post-Chorus]
But you touched my face

Redefined all of those blues when you say ""honey""


[Verse 1]
Summertime spritz, pink skies

You can call me ""honey"" if you want because I'm the one you want

Wintergreen kiss, all mine

You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk

Honey, I'm home, we could play house
We can bed down, pick me up

Who's the baddest in the land?
 What's the plan? (What's the plan?)
You could be my forever-night stand, honey



[Chorus]
When anyone called me ""sweetheart""
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the bitch was telling me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong
If anyone called me ""honey""
It was standing in the bathroom, white teeth
They were saying that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home

[Post-Chorus]
But you touched my face

Redefined all of those blues when you say—


[Verse 2]
You can call me ""honey"" if you want because I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want
You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk
Sweetie, it's yours, kicking in doors

Take it to the floor, give me more
Buy the paint in the color of your eyes (Of your eyes)

And graffiti my whole damn life, honey

[Bridge]
When anyone called me late night
He was screwing around with my mind
Asking, ""What are you wearing?"", too high
To remember in the morning

And when anyone called me ""lovely""
They were finding ways not to praise me

But you say it like you're in awe of me
And you stay until the morning

Honey


[Chorus]
When anyone called me ""sweetheart""
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the bitch was telling me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong (He looked at me wrong)
If anyone called me ""honey"" (Ooh)
It was standing in the bathroom (Yeah), white teeth
They were saying that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home (Cried the whole way home)

But you can call me ""honey"" if you want"

[Intro]
Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name

Chasing that fame, he stayed the same

All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 1]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders

But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean

I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name

Chasing that fame, he stayed the same

All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 2]
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day

So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel

And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain


[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name

Chasing that fame, he stayed the same

All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name

Chasing that fame, he stayed the same

All of me changed like midnight

[Outro]
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted

And he never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV

I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted

And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
(Midnights like this, midnights like this)"

[Verse 1]
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you

There is an indentation in the shape of you

Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo


[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation

My hands are shakin' from holdin’ back from you, ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waitin'

My hands are shakin' from all this, ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops

I don’t want you like a best friend

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost

'Cause I don't want you like a best friend

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified

I'm spillin' wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk

Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin' about



[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation

My hands are shakin’ from holdin’ back from you, ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waitin'

Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me
Your buzzcut and my hair bleached

Even in my worst times
You could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes
My rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies
You saw the truth in me

And I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side

My one and only, my lifeline

I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can’t explain this, ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

I don't want you like a best friend

[Intro: James Reynolds]
Gorgeous


[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk

You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field bein' a little too strong

And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what

You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)


[Pre-Chorus]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not bein' mine


[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for makin' me feel this way
But what can I say? You're gorgeous


[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talkin' to everyone here but you (But you, but you)

And you should think about the consequence
Of you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)

If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single, that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)



[Pre-Chorus]
Ocean blue eyes lookin' in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die


[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for makin' me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? You're gorgeous


[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)

You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Ugh) alone
Unless you wanna come along (Oh)

You're so gorgeous (Gorgeous)
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; Gorgeous)

But what can I say? (I say) You're gorgeous

[Intro]
No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car


[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes

I struck a match and blew your mind

But I didn’t mean it and you didn't see it

The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him, I needed a reason


[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself

I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed

We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh)


[Chorus]
You were drivin’ the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far

Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me

Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart

Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me



[Post-Chorus]
In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)
No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)

No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car


[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break

The light of freedom on my face
But you weren’t thinkin’ and I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin’ after us, I was screamin', ""Go, go, go""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story and now we’re both sorry (We're both sorry)


[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself

I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed

It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh)

You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far

Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me

Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)
No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)

No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car


[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)

Until I switched to the other side, to the other side
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)

'Cause us traitors never win


[Breakdown]
I'm in a getaway car

I left you in a motel bar

Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh)


[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)

Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me

Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Shoulda known)

Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use

Somethin' happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise

Shaking, pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, ""She's gone too far this time""

Our coming-of-age has come and gone

Suddenly, this summer, it's clear

I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near

And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace


[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come

All these people think love's for show

But I would die for you in secret

The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me

Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?


[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small

You paint dreamscapes on the wall

I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor

And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences

Sit with you in the trenches

Give you my wild, give you a child

Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other

Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother

Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west

I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me



[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come

All these people think love's for show

But I would die for you in secret

The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me

Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?"

Ladies know what people want

While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine

And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents

Now and then, she rereads the manuscript
Of the entire torrid affair

They compared their licenses
He said, ""I'm not a donor but
I'd give you my heart if you needed it""

She rolled her eyes and said
""You're a professional""

He said, ""No, just a good Samaritan
""
He said that if the sex was half as good as the conversation was
Soon, they'd be pushin' strollers
But, soon, it was over

[Verse 2]
In the age of him, she wished she was thirty

And made coffee every morning in a Frеnch press

Afterwards, she only atе kids' cereal
And couldn't sleep unless it was in her mother's bed

Then she dated boys who were her own age
With dart boards on the backs of their doors

She thought about how he said since she was so wise beyond her years
Everything had been above board
She wasn't sure


[Bridge]
And the years passed like scenes of a show
The professor said to write what you know

Lookin' backwards might be the only way to move forward

Then the actors were hitting their marks

And the slow dance was alight with the sparks

And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score
And at last, she knew what the agony had been for

The only thing that's left is the manuscript
One last souvenir from my trip to your shores

Now and then, I reread the manuscript
But the story isn't mine anymore"

How Did It End? Lyrics
[Intro]
(Uh-oh, uh-oh)


[Verse 1]
We hereby conduct this post-mortem

He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman

Our maladies were such we could not cure them

And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign


[Chorus]

Come one, come all, it's happenin' again

The empathetic hunger descends

We'll tell no one except all of our friends

We must know
How did it end?

(Uh-oh, uh-oh)


[Verse 2]
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learned thе right steps to different dancеs

And fell victim to interlopers' glances

Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?

Soon, they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him

Then feverishly calling their cousins



[Chorus]

""Guess who we ran into at the shops?
Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear? They called it all off""

One gasp and then
""How did it end?""


[Bridge]
Say it once again with feeling

How the death rattle breathing

Silenced as the soul was leaving

The deflation of our dreaming

Leaving me bereft and reeling

My beloved ghost and me

Sitting in a tree
D-Y-I-N-G


[Pre-Chorus]
It's happenin' again

How did it end?
I can't pretend like I understand

How did it end?

[Chorus]
Come one, come all, it's happenin' again

The empathetic hunger descends

We'll tell no one except all of our friends

But I still don't know
How did it end"

I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you

I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?

With your hair falling into place like dominoes

I see me padding across your wooden floors

With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door

And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea

And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it

[Verse 1]

Your hologram stumbled into my apartment
Hands in the hair of somebody in darkness

Named Chloe or Sam or Sophia or Marcus

And I just watched it happen

As the decade would play us for fools

And you saw my bones out with somebody new

Who seemed like he would've bullied you in school

And you just watched it happen


[Chorus]
If you wanna break my cold, cold heart

Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""

If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered


[Verse 2]
You said some things that I can't unabsorb

You turned me into an idea of sorts

You needed me, but you needed drugs more

And I couldn't watch it happen

I changed into goddesses, villains, and fools

Changed plans and lovers and outfits and rules

All to outrun my desertion of you
And you just watched it



[Chorus]
If you wanna break my cold, cold heart

Just say, ""I loved you the way that you were""

If you wanna tear my world apart
Just say you've always wondered


[Bridge]
If the glint in my eye traced the depths of your sigh

Down that passage in time back to the moment
I crashed into you, like so many wrecks do

Too impaired by my youth to know what to do


[Verse 3]
So if I sell my apartment

And you have some kids with an internet starlet

Will that make your memory fade from this scarlet maroon

Like it never happened?

Could it be enough to just float in your orbit?

Can we watch our phantoms like watching wild horses?

Cooler in theory, but not if you force it to be

It just didn't happen


[Chorus]
So if you wanna break my cold, cold heart
Say you loved me

And if you wanna tear my world apart
Say you'll always wonder



[Outro]
'Cause I wonder
Will I always
Will I always wonder?"

[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat

I say I don't want that, but what if I do?

'Cause cruelty wins in the movies

I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you


[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go

I jump from the train, I ride off alone

I never grew up, it's getting so old

Help me hold on to you


[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?


[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?

And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years


[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost

The room is on fire, invisible smoke

And all of my heroes die all alone

Help me hold on to you



[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

(I see right through me, I see right through me)


[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me


[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you


[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

(I see right through me, I see right through me)

Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

[Intro]
Two, one, two, three, four

[Verse 1]
Hand on the throttle

Thought I caught lightning in a bottle

Oh, but it's gone again

And it was written
I got cursed like Eve got bitten

Oh, was it punishment?
Pad around when I get home

I guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
A greater woman wouldn't beg
But I looked to the sky and said

[Chorus]
""Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy

Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company

Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo the prophеcy?""

[Verse 2]
Cards on the table

Mine play out likе fools in a fable

Oh, it was sinking in (Sinking in, oh)
Slow is the quicksand

Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand

Oh, still I dream of him



[Chorus]
Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy

Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company

Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo the prophecy?

[Bridge]
And I sound like an infant
Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen

A greater woman stays cool

But I howl like a wolf at the moon

And I look unstable
Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table

A greater woman has faith
But even statues crumble if they're made to wait

I'm so afraid I sealed my fate
No sign of soulmates
I'm just a paperweight in shades of greige

Spending my last coin so someone will tell me, ""It'll be okay""

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy

Don't want money

Just someone who wants my company

Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo the prophecy?
Who do I have to speak to
To change the prophecy?


[Outro]
Hand on the throttle

Oh, but it's gone again

Been sittin' eyes wide open
Behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call
It's just a cruel existence

Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day

[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to

And that would be okay for me to do

Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type

When everyone believes ya, what's that like?

I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man

And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man (Man)
I’d be the man (Man)


[Verse 2]
They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve

What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves


[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh (Ayy), let the players play

I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man

And I’m so sick of them comin' at me again

What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad

If I was out flashin' my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller

They'd paint me out to be bad
So it's okay that I'm mad

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man

The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)

Peter Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Forgive me, Peter

My lost fearless leader

In closets like cedar
Preserved from when we were just kids

Is it somethin' I did?
The goddess of timing

Once found us beguiling

She said she was trying
Peter, was she lying?

My ribs get the feeling she did


[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna come down

I thought it was just goodbye for now


[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Thеn you were gonna come find mе
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me

Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans-deep
But never to keep
Oh, never to keep



[Verse 2]
Are you still a mind reader?
A natural scene-stealer?
I've heard great things, Peter
But life was always easier on you
Than it was on me

And sometimes it gets me
When crossing your jet stream
We both did the best we could do
Underneath the same moon
In different galaxies


[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna hang around
We said it was just goodbye for now


[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up

Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes
Promises oceans-deep
But never to keep
Never to keep



[Bridge]
And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn

As the men masqueraded, I hoped you'd return

With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you'd learned

'Cause love's never lost when perspective is earned

And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired

Lost to the ""Lost Boys"" chapter of your life

Forgive me, Peter, please know that I tried
To hold on (Hold on) to the days (To the days)
When you were mine
But the woman who sits by the window
Has turned out the light


[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me

You know I left a part of me back in New York

You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?

You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart

You knew the password so I let you in the door

You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?

You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart

But what you did was just as dark
(Ah, ah, ah)
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

You have beaten my heart

No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that

And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht

Doing your dirtiest work for you

Has really brought you two together

I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me

Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me

She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but

No one likes a mad woman

No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn

At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires

And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out 'cause

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)

I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime

But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die


[Post-Chorus: HAIM & Taylor Swift]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Danielle Haim]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene

Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me (She was with me, dude)

Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy



[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it


[Outro: Taylor Swift & HAIM]
No, no body, no crime

I wasn't lettin' up until the day he

No, no body, no crime

I wasn't lettin' up until the day he

No, no body, no crime

I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died"

[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy

Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you


[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""

Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me

The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you


[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?

I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say

""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""

All I know is I was enchanted to meet you



[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go

I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck,
 dancing around all alone

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends

My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again

These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon

I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)


[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)

Dancing around all alone

I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you"

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present

Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five

And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight

[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""

Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve

Sapphire tears on my face

Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone

Just 'cause he was high

But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine

Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)

And when I meet the band

Familiarity breeds contempt

Don't put me in the basement

And you can try to change my mind

[Verse 1]
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene

Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights

American glory faded before me

Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress

Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)


[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile

I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world

They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)

The whole school is rolling fake dice

You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes

It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue

Voted most likely to run away with you



[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising

I see the high fives between the bad guys

Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care

American stories burning before me

I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?

Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my muffled cries

I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)

The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes

Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you

[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar

""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""

I say casually in the car

We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go

As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home


[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again


[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air

Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours

We bless the rains on Cornelia Street

Memorize the creaks in the floor

Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on

I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone


[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand

I turned around before I hit the tunnel

Sat on the roof, you and I


[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again


[Bridge]

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside

Barefoot in the kitchen

Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen


[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

In heart-stopping waves of hurt

I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze

I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you

I want auroras and sad prose

I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet

'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it

While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the Lakes, where all the poets went to die

I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry

Standin' at the bar like something's funny, bubbly
Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in (Yeah)

Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet

Small talk, big love, act like I don't care what you did
I'm an Aston Martin that you steered straight into the ditch
Then ran and hid

And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can take the upper hand and touch your body
Flip the script and leave you like a dumb house party

Or I might just love you 'til the end

Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I haven't decided yet

Bygones will be bygone, eras fadin' into gray (Fading into gray)

We broke all the pieces, but still wanna play the game (Oh)

Pick your poison, babe, I'm poison either way

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood

You know it used to be mad love

So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey


[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted

Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood

You know it used to be mad love

So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey



[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds, they last and they last

Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you

And time can heal, but this won't

So if you're comin' my way, just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I


[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood

You know it used to be mad love

So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey


[Bridge]
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes (Hey)
You say sorry just for show (Hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Hey), mmm
If you love like that, blood runs cold



[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood

You know it used to be mad love

So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey (Bad blood)

Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Don't think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey ('Cause now we got bad blood)

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood

You know it used to be mad love

Cassandra Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was in my new house placing daydreams
Patching up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying

'Cause that's where I was when I got the call


[Pre-Chorus]
When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'

In the streets, there's a raging riot

When it's ""Burn the bitch,"" they're shrieking

When the truth comes out, it's quiet


[Chorus]
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst

And tried to tell the town

So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say

Do you believe me now?


[Verse 2]
I was in my tower weaving nightmares

Twisting all my smiles into snarls

They say, ""What doesn't kill you makes you aware""

What happens if it becomes who you are?


[Chorus]
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst

And tried to tell the town

So they set my life in flames, I regret to say

Do you believe me now?


[Bridge]

They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
That I was onto somethin'

The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line

They all said nothin'

Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll

Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul

You can mark my words that I said it first

In a mourning warning, no one heard


[Verse 3]
I patched up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying

'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all


[Chorus]
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst

And tried to tell the town

So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say

Do you believe me now?


[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah
I was onto somethin'

Ah, ah
They all said nothin'
Blood's thick but nothin' like a payroll

Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul

You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning, no one heard
No one heard, not a single word was heard



[Outro]
When the first stone's thrown, there's screamin'

In the streets, there's a raging riot
When it's ""Burn the bitch,"" they're shrieking

When the truth comes out, it's quiet
It's so quiet"

And now we're talkin'

And you'll be watchin'

And if history's clear, someone always ends up in ruins

And what seemed like fate becomes ""What the hell was I doin'?""

Babylon lovers hangin' lifetimes on a vine (Ooh)

Do you miss mine?

It felt like somethin' old
It felt like somethin' holy, like souls bleedin', so

It fеlt like what I've known
You're twеnty-nine years old

So how can you be cold when I open my home?



[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Gracie Abrams & Taylor Swift]
And if history's clear, the flames always end up in ashes

And what seemed like fate, give it ten months and you'll be past it (You'll be past it)

Babylon lovers hangin' missed calls on the line

I gave you mine

Did you mind us, us?
I felt it, you held it, do you miss us, us?

Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us

[Bridge: Gracie Abrams & Taylor Swift]
That night, you were talkin' false prophets and profits

They make in the margins of poetry sonnets

You never read up on it, shame, could've learned somethin'

Robert Bly on my nightstand, gifts from you, how ironic

The curse or a miracle, hearse or an oracle

You're incomparable, fuck, it was chemical

You (You) plus (Plus) me (Me) was

[Chorus: Gracie Abrams & Taylor Swift, Gracie Abrams]
Us, us, us
I felt it, you held it, do you miss us, us?

Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us
Mistaken for strangers the way it was, was

The pain of, the reign of, the flame of us, us

The outline, well, some times, do you miss us, us?
The best kind, well, sometimes, do you miss us?"

[Verse 1]
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you

It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend

​'Tis the damn season
, write this down

I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now

And it always leads to you and my hometown


[Verse 2]
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours

The holidays linger like bad perfume

You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down

I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now

Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires

Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around

And the road not taken looks real good now

And it always leads to you and my hometown


[Bridge]
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake

I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends

Who'll write books about me if I ever make it

And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own

To leave the warmest bed I've ever known

We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down

I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now

Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out

[Verse 1]
When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone

Wake up in the mornin' with someone
But feelin' alone

[Refrain]
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine

Sneakin' out into town
Holdin' hands, just killin' time

[Pre-Chorus]
Your past and mine are parallel lines

Stars all aligned and they intertwined

And taught you
The way you call me ""baby""

Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is

[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)

Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me

Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for

All of the girls you loved before

But I love you more


[Verse 2]
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town (Ooh)
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now


[Refrain]
Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild (Ooh)
Breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye (Ooh)

[Pre-Chorus]
And just know that
It's everything that made me

Now I call you ""baby""
It's why you're so amazing

[Chorus]
All of the girls you loved before (Ooh)

Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me

Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for

All of the girls you loved before

But I love you more

Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here

I wanna teach you how forever feels

Like the girls you loved before (Ooh)

Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street (Dead-end street) led you straight to me (Straight to me)

Now you're all I need (All I need), I'm so thankful for

Girls carryin’ their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor

But I stay when you're lost and I’m scared and you're turnin' away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleanin' up bottles with you on New Year's Day


[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road

I'll be there if you’re the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you’re crawlin' home

Don’t read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're makin’ mistakes
I want your midnights

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please, don't ever become a stranger

Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor

Wise men once said
""Wild winds are death to the candle""

A rose by any other name is a scandal

Cautions issued, he stood
Shooting the messengers

They tried to warn him about her

Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you

She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you

Wise men once said
""One bad seed kills the garden""
""One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen""

Locked me up in towers

But I'd visit in your dreams
And they tried to warn you about me

Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you

She's the albatross

She is here to destroy you
Devils that you know
Raise worse hell than a stranger

She's the death you chose
You're in terrible danger

And when that sky rains fire on you

And you're persona non grata

I'll tell you how I've been there too
And that none of it matters


[Verse 3]
Wise men once read fake news
And they believed it

Jackals raised their hackles

You couldn't conceive it
You were sleeping soundly
When they dragged you from your bed
And I tried to warn you about them

[Chorus]
So I crossed my thoughtless heart
Spread my wings like a parachute
I'm the albatross
I swept in at the rescue

The devil that you know
Looks now more like an angel

I'm the life you chose
And all this terrible danger

So cross your thoughtless heart

But no one heard a thing

Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves

Went off like sirens, just crying

[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts

Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby

I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up

Chandelier's still flickering here

’Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not

It's death by a thousand cuts


[Verse]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home

I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""

And what once was ours is no one's now

I see you everywhere, the only thing we share

Is this small town

You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story’s over, why am I still writing pages?



[Chorus]
’Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts

Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
’Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby

I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up

Chandelier's still flickering here

'Cause I can’t pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Bridge]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch

Gave up on me like I was a bad drug

Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club

Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand

Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans

My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust

Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough

But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby

I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up

Chandelier's still flickering here

'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)


[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no

I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know"""

[Verse 1]
Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were

All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve

You got me fucked up in the head, boy

Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff


[Chorus]

'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back

I'm the love of your life until I make you mad

It's always one step forward and three steps back

Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand

No, I don't understand

[Verse 2]
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?


[Chorus]

It's one step forward and three steps back

I'm the love of your life until I make you mad

It's always one step forward and three steps back

Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand



[Bridge]
No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead


[Chorus]

It's one step forward and three steps back

And I'd leave you, but the rollercoaster's all I've ever had

Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back

Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand"

[Verse 1]
I know I'm probably better off on my own

Than lovin’ a man who didn't know what he had when he had it

And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic


[Pre-Chorus]
I wish it wasn't 4AM, standin’ in the mirror
Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""

I know the bravest thing I ever did was run


[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand

But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Verse 2]
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms, I waited on every careless word

Hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning

[Pre-Chorus]
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now

Talking down to me like I'd always be around

Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run



[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand

But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all I have
And I gave to you my best

And we both know you can't say that

[Breakdown]
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would've been the one if you were a better man


[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)

We might still be in love, if you were a better man
(But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would’ve been the one if you were a better man"

[Verse 1]
I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age


[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders

One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world


[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved

I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you

I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day

When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you


[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"

False God Lyrics
“False God” uses heavy religious imagery to compare Swift’s relationship with her then boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, to something all-powerful and greater than themselves.
[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think

Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?

We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us

Remember how I’d fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City

I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this

They say the road gets hard and you get lost

When you're led by blind faith, blind faith


[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love



[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey

Hell is when I fight with you

But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness

Got the wine for you


[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you

You're the West Village

You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this

They say the road gets hard and you get lost

When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah

[Verse 1]
By all accounts, she almost drowned
When she was six in frigid water
And I can confirm she made
A curious child, ever reviled
By everyone except her own father

With a quite bewitching face
Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless

Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
Then she runs like it's a race

Behind her back, her best mates laughed

And they nicknamed her ""The Bolter""


[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening

Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing


[Post-Chorus]
All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes

It feels like the time
She fell through the ice

Then came out alive


[Verse 2]
He was a cad, wanted her bad

Just like any good trophy hunter

And she liked the way it tastes
Taming a bear, making him care

Watching him jump then pulling him under
And at first blush, this is fate

When it's all roses, portrait poses

Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats

What a charming Saturday
That's when she sees the littlest leaks
Down in the floorboards

And she just knows she must bolt

[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening

Ended with the slam of a door
Then he'll call her a whore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing

[Post-Chorus]
All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes (Ah-ah-ah)
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive


[Bridge]

She's been many places with
Men of many faces

First, they're off to the races
And she's laughing, drawin' aces

But none of it is changin'
That the chariot is waitin'
Hearts are hers for the breakin'
There's escape in escaping


[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening

Ended with the slam of a door
But she's got the best stories

You can be sure
That as she was leaving
It felt like freedom

[Post-Chorus]
All her fuckin' lives
Flashed before her eyes (And she realized)
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive"

""It only hurts this much right now""
Was what I was thinkin' the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out

I'll be gettin' over you my whole life

You know how scared I am of elevators

Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last

Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?


[Verse 2]
It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind

Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile

You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that

[Verse 1]
You had people who called you on unmarked numbers
In my peripheral vision

I let it slide like a hose on a slippery plastic summer

All was quickly forgiven
You were so magnetic, it was almost obnoxious

Flush with the currency of cool
I was always turnin' out my empty pockets

And when it came to you

[Chorus]
I didn't come here to make friends

We were born to be suburban legends

When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever


[Verse 2]
I had the fantasy that maybe our mismatched star signs

Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion

Walkin' in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries

With the pages ripped out
I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium

And I can still see you now


[Chorus]
I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I know that you still remember

We were born to be national treasures
When you told me we'd get back together

And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever


[Outro]
Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block

I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it

Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined

Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it

Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore and I always knew it
That my life would be ruined"

My knuckles were bruised like violets

Sucker punching walls, cursed you as I sleep-talked

Spineless in my tomb of silence

Tore your banners down, took the battle underground

And maybe it was egos swinging

Maybe it was her

Flashes of the battle come back to me in a blur


[Chorus]
All that bloodshed, crimson clover

Uh-huh, sweet dream was over
My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War

Always remember
Uh-huh, tears on the lеtter
I vowed not to cry anymore
If wе survived the Great War

[Verse 2]
You drew up some good faith treaties

I drew curtains closed, drank my poison all alone

You said I have to trust more freely

But diesel is desire, you were playing with fire

And maybe it's the past that's talking
Screaming from the crypt

Telling me to punish you for things you never did

So I justified it


[Chorus]
All that bloodshed, crimson clover

Uh-huh, the bombs were closer

My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War

Always remember
Uh-huh, the burning embers

I vowed not to fight anymore

If we survived the Great War

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh, uh-huh

[Bridge]
It turned into something bigger

Somewhere in the haze, got a sense I'd been betrayed

Your finger on my hairpin triggers

Soldier down on that icy ground

Looked up at me with honor and truth

Broken and blue, so I called off the troops

That was the night I nearly lost you
I really thought I'd lost you


[Verse 3]
We can plant a memory garden
Say a solemn prayer, place a poppy in my hair
There's no morning glory, it was war, it wasn't fair

And we will never go back



[Chorus]
To that bloodshed, crimson clover
Uh-huh, the worst was over

My hand was the one you reached for
All throughout the Great War

Always remember
Uh-huh, we're burned for better

I vowed I would always be yours
'Cause we survived the Great War

Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here

If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?

And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?

Did I shatter you?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering, where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights
, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down


[Verse 2: Matt Berninger with Taylor Swift]
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge
But you were too polite to leave me?

And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?

Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?



[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Matt Berninger]
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be

The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring

Over and over
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger, Both]
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line by the gold clock

Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday

Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?

A universe away
And when I got into the accident

The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium
I think that I forgot to say your name

I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering, where did my baby go?

Like your friends were the night that we first met

Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet

Cat and mouse for a month or two or three

Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)

When you jumped in first, I went in too

I'm with you even if it makes me blue

Which takes me back

Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so

I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye

And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

[Bridge]
So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It's the best seat in the best room

Oh, he's so smug, Mr. ""Always wins""

So far above me in every sense

So far above feelin' anything
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame

'Cause I was Miss ""Here to stay""
Now I'm Miss ""Gonna be alright someday""

And someday, maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. ""Too late""



[Chorus]
Goodbye, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?

Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby

Goodbye, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery for the last time

And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

[Outro]
You're perfectly fine
Mr. ""Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away""
You said you'd never go away"

[Verse 1]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?

When we were younger, down in the park
Honey, makin' a lark of the misery

You got shiny friends since you left town

A tiny screen's the only place I see you now

And I got nothin' but well wishes for ya


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
This place is the same as it ever was
Ooh
But you won't like it that way

[Chorus]
It's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo

And if you're ever tired of bеin' known for who you know
You know that you'll always know me
Dorothea, uh-uh
Dorothea, ah-ah

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh
You'rе a queen sellin' dreams, sellin' makeup and magazines

Ooh
From you, I'd buy anything


[Verse 2]
Hey, Dorothea, do you ever stop and think about me?
When it was calmer, skippin' the prom
Just to piss off your mom and her pageant schemes

And damn, Dorothea, they all wanna be ya
But are you still the same soul I met under the bleachers? Well


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh
I guess I'll never know
Ooh
And you'll go on with the show

[Chorus]
But it's never too late to come back to my side
The stars in your eyes shined brighter in Tupelo

And if you're ever tired of bein' known for who you know
You know, you'll always know me
Dorothea, uh-uh
Dorothea, ah-ah

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh-woo-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

Robin Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Long may you reign

You're an animal, you are bloodthirsty
Out window panes talking utter nonsense

You have no idea

[Pre-Chorus]
Strings tied to levers

Slowed-down clocks tethered

All this showmanship

To keep it for you in sweetness


[Chorus]
Way to go, tiger

Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you


[Verse 2]
Long may you roar
At your dinosaurs

You're a just ruler

Covered in mud, you look ridiculous
And you have no idea


[Pre-Chorus]
Buried down deep

And out of your reach
The secret we all vowed
To keep it from you in sweetness



[Chorus]
Way to go, tiger
Higher and higher
Wilder and lighter
For you

[Bridge]
You got the dragonflies above your bed

You have a favorite spot on the swing set

You have no room in your dreams for regrets

(You have no idea)
The time will arrive for the cruel and the mean

You'll learn to bounce back just like your trampoline

But now we'll curtail your curiosity
In sweetness


[Chorus]
Way to go, tiger (Way to go, tiger)
Higher and higher (Higher and higher)
Wilder and lighter
For you"

[Verse]
Friends break up, friends get married

Strangers get born, strangers get buried

Trends change, rumors fly through new skies

But I'm right where you left me

Matches burn after the other

Pages turn and stick to each other

Wages earned and lessons learned
But I, I'm right where you left me


[Pre-Chorus]
Help, I'm still at the restaurant

Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight,"" I
I swear you could hear a hair pin drop

Right when I felt the moment stop

Glass shattered on the white cloth

Everybody moved on, I, I stayed there

Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
They expected me to find somewhere
Some perspective, but I sat and stared right where


[Chorus]
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever



[Bridge]
Did you ever hear about the girl who got frozen?
Time went on for everybody else, she won't know it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy
How it was supposed to be
Did you hear about the girl who lives in delusion?
Breakups happen every day, you don't have to lose it
She's still twenty-three inside her fantasy

And you're sitting in front of me

[Pre-Chorus]
At the restaurant
When I was still the one you want

Cross-legged in the dim light
Everything was just right, I

I could feel the mascara run
You told me that you met someone

Glass shattered on the white cloth

Everybody moved on
Help, I'm still at the restaurant

Still sitting in a corner I haunt
Cross-legged in the dim light
They say, ""What a sad sight,"" I,
 I stayed there
Dust collected on my pinned-up hair
I'm sure that you got a wife out there
Kids and Christmas
, but I'm unaware 'cause I'm right where

I cause no harm, mind my business
If our love died young, I can't bear witness, and it's been so long
If you ever think you got it wrong, I'm right where


[Chorus]
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever
You left me, you left me no, oh, you left me no
You left me no choice but to stay here forever"

""Your ex-friend's sister
Met someone at a club and he kissed her
Turns out, it was that guy you hooked up with ages ago
Some wannabe Z-lister
And all the outfits were terrible
2003 unbearable

Did you see the photos?""
No, I didn't, but thanks, though

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling

No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne

I was taken by the view


[Chorus]
Like we were in Paris
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else


[Verse 2]
Privacy sign on the door
And on my page and on the whole world
Romance is not dead if you keep it just yours

Levitate above all the messes made
Sit quiet by my side in the shade
And not the kind that's thrown
I mean, the kind under where a tree has grown



[Pre-Chorus]
I'm so in love that I might stop breathing
Drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
Stumbled down pretend alleyways
Cheap wine, make believe it's champagne

I was taken by the view

[Chorus]
Like we were in Paris, oh
Like we were somewhere else
Like we were in Paris, oh
We were somewhere else


[Bridge]
I wanna brainwash you
Into loving me forever

I wanna transport you
To somewhere the culture's clever
Confess my truth
In swooping, sloping, cursive letters

Let the only flashing lights be the tower at midnight

In my mind

[Breakdown]
We drew a map on your bedroom ceiling
No, I didn't see the news
'Cause we were somewhere else
In an alleyway, drinking champagne

'Cause we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else
My love, we were in Paris
Yes, we were somewhere else"

The autumn chill that wakes me up

You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch

And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs

I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be

Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me



[Chorus]
What died didn't stay dead
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead

You're alive, so alive

[Verse 1]
See you in the dark

All eyes on you, my magician
All eyes on us
You make everyone disappear and
Cut me into pieces

Gold cage, hostage to my feelings

Back against the wall
Trippin', trip-trippin' when you're gone


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we break down a little
But when you get me alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know
We can feel it

[Chorus]
And all the pieces fall right into place

Gettin' caught up in a moment, lipstick on your face
So it goes
I'm yours to keep and I'm yours to lose

You know I'm not a bad girl, but I do bad things with you

So it goes


[Verse 2]
Met you in a bar
All eyes on me, your illusionist

All eyes on us

I make all your gray days clear and

Wear you like a necklace

I'm so chill, but you make me jealous

But I got your heart
Skippin', skip-skippin' when I'm gone

'Cause we break down a little
But when I get you alone, it's so simple
'Cause, baby, I know what you know

[Verse 1]
It was so nice throwin' big parties
Jump into the pool from the balcony
Everyone swimmin' in a champagne sea
And there are no rules when you show up here
Bass beat rattling the chandelier

Feelin' so Gatsby for that whole year


[Pre-Chorus]
So why'd you have to rain on my parade?
I'm shaking my head and locking the gates


[Chorus]

This is why we can't have nice things, darlin'
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey (Oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things


[Verse 2]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But you stabbed me in the back while shakin' my hand

And therein lies the issue, friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence



[Pre-Chorus]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately (Mm-mm)
If only you weren't so shady


[Chorus]

This is why we can't have nice things, darlin' (Yeah)
Because you break them, I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice (Nice things) things (Baby), honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have


[Bridge]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said, she-said

And here's to my baby
He ain't readin' what they call me lately

And here's to my mama
Had to listen to all this drama

And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do

Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face (This is why we can't have)


[Chorus]

This is why we can't have nice things, darlin' (Darlin')
Because you break them, I had to take them away (Away)
This is why we can't have nice (Uh, uh) things (Oh, no), honey (Baby, oh)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have (Oh) nice (Oh, no) things, darlin'

(And here's to my real friends; Oh)

Because you break them, I had to take them (Away)

(And here's to my baby; Oh)

Nice things (Oh, no), honey

First sight, yeah, we love without reason

My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden

Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I

I could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets

Picture of your face in an invisible locket

You said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feelin'
And darlin', you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talkin', puttin' us through our paces

I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feelin'

But we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'

I, I loved you in spite of
Deep fears that the world would divide us

So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche?
 And
Say, say that we got it
I'm a mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted

Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I

Swayin' as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swayin' as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again (Again, yeah)

Shoot you down and then they sigh

Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

But nothin' at twenty-two?

And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?


[Verse 2: Phoebe Bridgers]

How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection

And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles

Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?

And someone else lights up the room (Ah)

People love an ingénue (Ah)

But nothing at twenty-two?

And will you still want me

I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep

Oh, woah, oh (Oh)
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh (Oh)

I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out

I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving

How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?

And will you still want me

And you passed right by
I was in the alley, surrounded on all sides
The knife cuts both ways
If the shoe fits, walk in it 'til your high heels break


[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal

Right down the rabbit hole

Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah
Yeah, yeah

Actually
I always felt I must look better in the rear view

Missing me
At the golden gates they once held the keys to

When I dropped my sword
I threw it in the bushes and knocked on your door

And we live in peace

But if someone comes at us, this time, I'm ready

As you boarded your train
South, south, south, south, south, south


[Pre-Chorus]
A feather taken by the wind blowing
I'm afflicted by the not knowing, so


[Chorus]
I look in people's windows

Transfixed by rose golden glows

They have their friends over to drink nice wine
I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table

What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time?

[Verse 2]
You had stopped and tiltеd your head
I still ponder what it meant
Now, now, now, now, now, now
I triеd searching faces on streets
What are the chances you'd be
Downtown, downtown, downtown



[Pre-Chorus]
Does it feel alright to not know me?
I'm addicted to the ""if only""


[Chorus]
So I look in people's windows
Like I'm some deranged weirdo

I attend Christmas parties from outside

I look in people's windows
In case you're at their table

What if your eyes looked up and met mine
One more time?"

[Verse 1]
How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?

Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone

And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah

Your name on my lips, tongue-tied

Free rent, living in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But then something happened one magical night


[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you


[Verse 2]
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down

Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground

And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show



[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed who you are, then one magical night


[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you


[Bridge]
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons

I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference

So, yeah"

[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch

I remember

You took a Polaroid of us

Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

(Are we out of the woods?)


[Verse 2]

Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck

The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance

Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

And I remember thinking


[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

(Are we out of the woods?)


[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you

Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, ""I'm setting you free""

But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember



[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)

[Verse 1]
Flashing lights
And we took a wrong turn

And we fell down a rabbit hole

You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control


[Pre-Chorus]

Didn't they tell us ""Don't rush into things""?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?

Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me

I should have slept with one eye open at night


[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but never better (Eh, eh)

[Verse 2]
So, we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone, or so it seemed
But there were strangers watchin'
And whispers turned to talkin'
And talking turned to screams, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't they tell us ""Don't rush into things""?

Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?
I felt your arms twistin' around me

It's all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind

But darling

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better (Eh, eh)

I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for somethin' else
To make you feel like what we had

And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad

Oh

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Last forever; Eh, eh)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better (Never better; Eh, eh)

When Emma Falls in Love (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault] Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When Emma falls in love, she paces the floor

Closes the blinds and locks the door
When Emma falls in love, she calls up her mom
Jokes about the ways that this one could go wrong
She waits and takes her time
'Cause Little Miss Sunshine always thinks it's gonna rain

When Emma falls in love, I know
That boy will never be the same

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down

Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town

And all the bad boys would be good boys

If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her


[Verse 2]
When Emma falls in love, it's all on her face
Hangs in the air like stars in outer space
When Emma falls in love, she disappears
And we all just laugh after seein' it all these years
When Emma falls apart, it's when she's alone
She takes on the pain and bears it on her own

'Cause when Emma falls in love, she's in it for keeps
She won't walk away unless she knows she absolutely has to leave


[Chorus]
And she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town

And all the bad boys would be good boys

If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

[Bridge]
Well, she's so New York when she's in L.A.​​

She won't lose herself in love the way that I did
'Cause she'll call you out, she'll put you in your place
When Emma falls in love, I'm learning


[Verse 3]
Emma met a boy with eyes like a man

Turns out her heart fits right in the palm of his hand

Now he'll be her shelter when it rains
Little does he know, his whole world's about to change

[Chorus]
'Cause she's the kind of book that you can't put down
Like if Cleopatra grew up in a small town

And all the bad boys would be good boys

If they only had a chance to love her
And to tell you the truth, sometimes I wish I was her

Yeah, between me and you, sometimes I wish I was her"

I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night

I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine


[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man

I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans

It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands


[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat

Skipping down 16th Avenue

Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Verse 2]
I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)



[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man

I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans

He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue

Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my soul

Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh

We could follow the sparks, I'll drive

Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
We could follow the sparks, I'll drive

""So where we gonna go?""
I whisper in the dark
""Where we gonna go?""
I think he knows



[Chorus]
He got my heartbeat (Heartbeat)
Skipping down 16th Avenue (Baby)

Got that, ah, I mean (I mean)
Wanna see what's under that attitude like (Yeah)
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my
I want you, bless my (Oh, baby)
I want you, bless my soul (He got my heartbeat)
I want you, bless my (Skipping down 16th Avenue, baby)
I want you, bless my

Dear reader,
 if it feels like a trap
You're already in one
Dear reader, get out your map
Pick somewhere and just run

Dear reader, burn all the files
Desert all your past lives
And if you don't recognize yourself
That means you did it right

[Chorus]
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
 (You should find another)

[Verse 2]
Dear reader, bend when you can
Snap when you have to

Dear reader, you don't have to answer
Just 'cause they asked you

(You should find another)
Dear reader, the greatest of luxuries is your secrets

Dear reader, when you aim at the devil
Make sure you don't miss

[Chorus]
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart
Never take advice from someone who's falling apart



[Bridge]
So I wander through these nights
I prefer hiding in plain sight

My fourth drink in my hand
These desperate prayers of a cursed man
Spilling out to you for free

But darling, darling, please

You wouldn't take my word for it if you knew who was talking

If you knew where I was walking
To a house, not a home, all alone 'cause nobody's there
Where I pace in my pen and my friends found friends who care
No one sees when you lose when you're playing solitaire


[Outro]
You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another guiding light, guiding light
But I shine so bright
You should find another, you should find another (Guiding light)
Find another, you should find another
You should find another"

[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you

Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain

And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday

Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known


[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""



[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong

Don't you think nineteen's too young

To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known


[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests

All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out

But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh, oh


[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known

You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?

[Verse 1]
Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a 30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met

[Chorus]
On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war

You still would've been mine

We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless


[Verse 2]
I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop

I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot

[Pre-Chorus]
That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs

Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face


[Chorus]
In the 1500s, off in a foreign land

And I was forced to marry another man

You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless


[Bridge]
Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, ""Hello""

[Chorus]
In a crowded room a few short years ago

And sometimes there's no proof, you just know

You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, ""Oh my, we really were timeless""


[Post-Chorus]
We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been

Down the block, there's an antique shop
And somethin' in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in"

Foolish One (Taylor’s Version) [From The Vault] Lyrics
[Verse 1]
My cards are on the table, yours are in your hand

Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high

Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right

And I will block out these voices of reason in my head


[Pre-Chorus]
And the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson""


[Chorus]
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love

That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down

[Verse 2]
You know how to keep me waitin'
I know how to act like I'm fine

Don't know what to call this situation

But I know I can't call you mine

And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof

'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
It starts thinkin' you'll come around
And maybe, someday, when we're older
This is something we'll laugh about

Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news


[Pre-Chorus]
But then the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson""


[Chorus]
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out

[Bridge]
Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
Sayin', ""How could I not see the signs?""

Oh, you haven't written me or called

But goodbye screamin' in the silence
And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring

And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson

[Chorus]
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out, oh-oh, oh, oh


[Outro]
La-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, oh
La-la-la-la-la
Ain't never gonna come
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
They ain't never gonna come
And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love
When all is said and done, he just wasn't the one
No, he just wasn't the one"

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)
(Once, I had an empire)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Once, I had an empire in a golden age

I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace


[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down

And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground

And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now


[Verse 2: Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty

Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift]
Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams, Taylor Swift]
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down

And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground

And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now


[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
My foes and friends watch my reign end

I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like I'm a monster

Now they're screamin' at the palace front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me


[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Hayley Williams]
My castle's crumbling down

And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground

And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down (Just let you down)

My castle's crumbling down

You don't wanna know me now, now

[Verse 1]
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything

We wait for trains that just aren't comin'

We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better

We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin

We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'

We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom

Honey, life is just a classroom

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me

And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me

Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics

The best people in life are free


[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding

We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace, ah

We need love, but all we want is danger

We team up, then switch sides like a record changer

The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah


[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me

And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me

Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin' (Yeah) to get knocked off our feet (Hey)
Baby, we're the new romantics

The best people in life are free


[Post-Chorus]
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) Oh
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) So, come on, come along with me
(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) The best people in life are free

Please, take my hand and
Please, take me dancing and
Please, leave me stranded
It's so romantic (It's so romantic)

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, I could build a castle (Oh)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me (At me)

And every day is like a battle (Oh)
But every night with us is like a dream (Is like a dream)

'Cause baby, I could build a castle (Castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me (And)

And every day is like a battle (Oh)
But every night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me

[Verse 1]
When the dinner is cold and the chatter gets old
You ask for the tab

Or that moment again, he's insisting that friends
Look at each other like that

When the words of a sister come back in whispers
That prove she was not
In fact what she seemed, not a twin from your dreams
She's a crook who was caught


[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache

The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul

You know when it's time to go


[Verse 2]
Twenty years at your job, then the son of the boss
Gets the spot that was yours
Or trying to stay for the kids, when keeping it how it is
Will only break their hearts worse


[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache

The snaps from the same little breaks in your soul

You know when it's time to go



[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes, to run is the brave thing

Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing

Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes, to run is the brave thing

Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing


[Verse 3]
Fifteen years, fifteen million tears

Begging 'til my knees bled

I gave it my all, he gave me nothin' at all
Then wondered why I left

Now he sits on his throne in his palace of bones
Praying to his greed
He's got my past frozen behind glass
But I've got me


[Chorus]
That old familiar body ache
The snaps from the same little breaks in my soul
I know when it's time to go

[Post-Chorus]
Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes, to run is the brave thing

Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing
Sometimes, givin' up is the strong thing
Sometimes, to run is the brave thing

Sometimes, walkin' out is the one thing
That will find you the right thing



[Outro]
That will find you the right thing
And you know in your soul
And you know in your soul
When it's time to go
And, well, you know, you know, you know, you know
When it's time to go

So then you go and then you go
You just go"

When she fell, she fell apart.
Cracked her bones on the pavement she once decorated
as a child with sidewalk chalk
When she crashed, her clothes disintegrated and blew away
with the winds that took all of her fair-weather friends


When she looked around, her skin was spattered with ink
forming the words of a thousand voices
Echoes she heard even in her sleep:
""Whatever you say, it is not right.""
""Whatever you do, it is not enough.""
""Your kindness is fake.""
""Your pain is manipulative.""


When she lay there on the ground,
She dreamed of time machines and revenge

and a love that was really something,
Not just the idea of something.

When she finally rose, she rose slowly
Avoiding old haunts and sidestepping shiny pennies
Wary of phone calls and promises,

Charmers, dandies and get-love-quick-schemes


When she stood, she stood with a desolate knowingness
Waded out into the dark, wild ocean up to her neck
Bathed in her brokenness
Said a prayer of gratitude for each chink in the armor
she never knew she needed

Standing broad-shouldered next to her
was a love that was really something,
not just the idea of something.



When she turned to go home,
She heard the echoes of new words
""May your heart remain breakable
But never by the same hand twice""
And even louder:
""without your past,
you could never have arrived-
so wondrously and brutally,
By design or some violent, exquisite happenstance
...here.""


And in the death of her reputation,
She felt truly alive."

[Verse 1]
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone


[Pre-Chorus]
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this


[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on

Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone

Been losing grip on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh

These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees

When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and

3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine

And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me


[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills

I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills


[Verse 4: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different

You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes



[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Mr. Superior Thinkin'
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy

And I bet you think about me


[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
""Why did you let her go?""
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?


[Verse 5: Taylor Swift]
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton, Taylor Swift]
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave

And, yeah, I bet you think about me



[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me


[Outro: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Chris Stapleton]
I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week

I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch

I bet you think about me when you say
""Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me""
I bet you think about me"

And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover

We could light a bunch of candles
And dance around the kitchen, baby

Pictures of when we were young would hang on the wall
We would sit on the stoop

See, I finally got you now, honey,
 I won't let you fall

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

Look in my eyes, they will tell you the truth
The girl in my story has always been you

I'd go down with the Titanic, it's true, for you, lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover (Save you a seat)

Can I go where you go? (Can I go where you go, baby?)
Can we always be this close?

One look, dark room, meant just for you

Time moved too fast, you play it back

Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke

No proof, not much, but you saw enough
Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck

He says, ""Look up"" and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love


[Verse 2]
Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday

You keep his shirt, he keeps his word

And for once, you let go of your fears and your ghosts

One step, not much, but it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks, you fight and you talk

One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love

You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love

And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round

And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown

And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love
You are in love

You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love (Ah)

You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you (Ah)

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me

You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing

You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard

Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man


[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation

You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you

I just wanna feel okay again


[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things

Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic

And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean

But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again

[Verse 3]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do

We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do


[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end

But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past


[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end

But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again

[Outro]
Hmm, hmm
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again"

Better Man Lyrics
A cut from Taylor Swift’s 2012 Red album, “Better Man” captures the feeling of getting out of a toxic, perhaps abusive, relationship and accepting the sorrow that follows the breakup. “Better Man” was… Read More 
[Verse 1]
I know I'm probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn't know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me

Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic


[Pre-Chorus]
I wish it wasn't 4 a.m., standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run


[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand

And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man


[Verse 2]
I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it's always on your terms
I'm hanging on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning


[Pre-Chorus]
But your jealousy, I can hear it now
You're talking down to me like I'll always be around

You push my love away like it's some kind of loaded gun

Boy, you never thought I'd run

[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand

And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
Better man

[Bridge]
I hold on to this pride because these days, it's all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that
You can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Yeah, yeah


[Chorus]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand

And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man

[Outro]
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
Could've been the one, if you were a better man
We might still be in love, if you were a better man

Better man"

[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away


[Verse 2]
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart

It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips


[Verse 3]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again

And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something

There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions



[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh


[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep

And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe

And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

[Verse 4]
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed

You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind


[Pre-Chorus]
So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss



[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips


[Outro]
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last"

[Verse 1]
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, ""Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""

He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity


[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checkin' up on him
He's up, 3AM, pacin'

He says, ""It's not just a phase I'm in
""
My voice comes out beggin'

[Chorus]
All this time, I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better

I'll be summer sun for you forever

Forever winter if you go


[Verse 2]
He seems fine most of the time, forcing smiles and never minds

His laugh is a symphony, when the lights go out, it's hard to breathe

I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head

Live my life scared to death he'll decide to leave instead



[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checkin' up on him
He's up, 5AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening

My voice comes out screamin'


[Chorus]
All this time, I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around

Too young to know it gets better

I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go


[Bridge]
If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it

I'd say, ""I love you even at your darkest and
Please, don't go""


[Chorus]
I didn't know
You were breakin' down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better

I'll be summer sun for you forever

Forever winter if you go



[Post-Chorus]
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
I'll be your summer sun forever

(Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 3AM, pacin'
All this time, I didn't know
(Ooh, ooh, ooh) At 5AM, wasted
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go


[Outro]
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
I say, ""Believe in one thing, I won't go away"""

[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away

Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme

Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down

And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress

We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose

And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd



[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down

And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


[Bridge]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you


[Chorus]

It was good
Never looking down

And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


[Outro]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you"

[Verse 1]
We were supposed to be just friends

You don't live in my part of town, but maybe I'll see you out some weekend
Depending on what kind of mood and situationship I'm in
And what's in my system

[Chorus]
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit

I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
I was supposed to sweat you out
In search of glorious happenings of happenstance on someone else's playground

But it's been two-thousand one-hundred ninety days of our love blackout
(Our love is blacking out)
The system's breaking down
(The system's breaking down)


[Chorus]
I think there's been a glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit

It must be counterfeit
I think there's been a glitch


[Bridge]
A brief interruption, a slight malfunction

I'd go back to wanting dudes who give nothing

I thought we had no chance
And that's romance, let's dance


[Chorus]
Glitch, oh, yeah
Five seconds later, I'm fastening myself to you with a stitch, oh, yeah
And I'm not even sorry, nights are so starry
Blood moonlit
It must be counterfeit (It must be counterfeit)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay

Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway

Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight

I've got my money on things goin' badly

Got a history of stories ending sadly

Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time


[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life

Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life

And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

[Verse 2: Patrick Stump, Taylor Swift & Patrick Stump]
I've been left in the rain lost and pining

I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying

'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart (Woah)
I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Patrick Stump]
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life

Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life

And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm


[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Patrick Stump]
I was thinking just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the stars align (Just one time)

And maybe I call you mine

And you won't need space

Or string me along while you decide
And just one time (Just one time)
Maybe the moment's right (The moment's right)

It's 8:05 and I see two headlights


[Chorus: Both, Taylor Swift, Patrick Stump]
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life

Got a feelin' your electric touch (Ooh)
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life

Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life (Life)

(You good to go?)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago

Is green eyes and freckles and your smile

In the back of my mind, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran & Taylor Swift]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you

And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift]
All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace

All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed"

[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Verse 1]
You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts


[Pre-Chorus]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now


[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

You are the best thing that's ever been mine


[Verse 2]
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place

You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes



[Pre-Chorus]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

You are the best thing that's ever been mine


[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands

I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""



[Chorus]
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last)

(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on)


[Outro]
Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now"

[Intro]


[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago

I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me
You found me-e-e-e-e

I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me
Without me-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me


[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground



[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble


[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry

Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning
You're drowning-ing-ing-ing-ing
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now, I see, now, I see
Now, I see-e-e-e-e


[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah


[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground



[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Yeah, trouble)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble


[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah


[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there)
So shame on me now (Knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Ooh)
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground


[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night

The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
And if I would've known
How many pieces you had crumbled into
I might have let them lay

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?

And let all your damage damage me

And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it’s time
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody


[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Is it insensitive for me to say
""Get your shit together so I can love you""?
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything
Or do you just not want to?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night

The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
You fire off missiles ’cause you hate yourself
But do you know you're demolishing me?

And then you squeeze my hand as I'm about to leave



[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Justin Vernon]
Is it insensitive for me to say
""Get your shit together so I can love you""?
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything
Or do you just not want to?

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
And if I would've known
How sharp the pieces were you'd crumbled into
I might’ve let them lay

Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it’s time

You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn’t be the first renegade to need somebody


[Outro: Taylor Swift, Justin Vernon]
To need somebody, to need somebody
To need somebody, to need
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
Is it insensitive for me to say
""Get your shit together so I can love you""?
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody

[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds

We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time


[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (Never)
Be the same


[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball

Now, all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me

Up in your room and our slates are clean

Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong

We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild



[Chorus]
And I never (Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh) (Never)
Saw you coming (Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh, Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh)

This is a state of grace

This is the worthwhile fight

Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel

This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real


[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never
Be the same

And I never (Never) (Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh, Oh oh, oh oh oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 1]
I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout

So many things that I wish you knew

So many walls up, I can't break through


[Chorus]
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'

And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah

When it all broke down

And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy

And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think, one day, I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here

But you held your pride like you should've held me


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending

Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

This is lookin' like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side

The battle's in your hands now

But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight

So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Verse 1]
Want is the cigarette smoke on a jacket
You wore to the wrong part of town

Desire is the sound of the whiskey
Telling me you miss me, can you come around?


[Pre-Chorus]
Passion is a passing thing
, it's
Accidental chemistry
 (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Lust is a liar, a short-lived fire

It ain't what you and I are at all

[Chorus]
Oh, it's a need, it's a need
I would go anywhere that you lead

I am hopeless, breathless, burning slow
Touch me, hold me, tell me, ""I won't let you go""
I won't leave, it's a need

[Verse 2]
Danger is a thousand prickles on my neck
That tell me to run or to freeze

Fear is the nightmare I had
, you were with someone else
You forgot about me

[Pre-Chorus]
Passion is a passing thing, it's
Accidental chemistry
 (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
Caught up in a feelin', it can be deceivin'

This is like breathing for me

Oh, it's a need, it's a need
I would go anywhere that you lead

Baby, it's always a new kiss every time we do this, the truth is (Ah-ah-ah-ah)
It's essential to me that you love me more than wishing, longing

Oh, it's a need (It's a need), it's a need (Ah-ah, ah-ah)

Ours Lyrics
“Ours” is a track on the deluxe edition of Taylor Swift’s 2010 album Speak Now. Like her song “Love Story,” it tells the tale of a love frowned upon by others.
[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs

If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you

And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you


[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind

People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough

But this love is ours


[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles

But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say

[Chorus]
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak

And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours


[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
And don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours"

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly

Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall

Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)
But loving him was red (Red, red)
(Red, red)


[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song

Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer

Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red (Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)



[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes

Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible when I still see it all in my head
In burning red

Burning, it was red


[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Woah)
Forgetting him was like tryin' to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red (Red, red)
Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Oh, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)


[Post-Chorus]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)

[Intro]
Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)

Haha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it

I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from


[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

(Think about what you did)


[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word

Woah, woah-ah-oh

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge

Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement

Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you

You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
You can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be

But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned

Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you

With your hands in your pockets

And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
Well I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now, every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then



[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
And I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned

Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me


[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Maren Morris]
I lived and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die

'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

Lonesome I'll always stay
Carolina knows why, for years, I roam
Free as these birds, light as whispers
Carolina knows

[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me here

And she's in my dreams

[Chorus]
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I'll make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

[Verse 2]
Carolina stains on the dress she left

Indelible scars, pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled

Carolina pines, won't you cover me?
Hide me like robes down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave


[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't see me here
Oh, they never did see me
And she's in my dreams

[Chorus]
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I'll make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

[Bridge]
And you didn't see me here
They never did see me here
No, you didn't see me here
They never saw me

[Outro]
Oh, Carolina knows why for years they've said
That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed

But the sleep comes fast and I'll meet no ghosts

It's between me, the sand, and the sea
Carolina knows"

[Verse 1]
Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow

Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats

Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before

And it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore

The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York


[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer

Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls


[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore

The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York



[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything


[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat

The lights are so bright, but they never blind me

Welcome to New York (New soundtrack), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, the lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, so bright, they never blind me, yeah

[Intro]

I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I, I-I (I, I)

[Verse 1]
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign

Somethin' happens when everybody finds out

See the vultures circling, dark clouds

Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Verse 2]
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences

Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time



[Pre-Chorus]
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run


[Chorus]
Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found
And they'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Bridge]
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found
And they'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Post-Chorus]
(I) They take their shots, but we're bulletproof (I know places)

(Hide) And you know, for me, it's always you (I know places)
(I) In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)

(Hide) And I know, for you, it's always me (I know places)

I Knew You Were Trouble (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago

I was in your sights, you got me alone

You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me


[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me


[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd nеver been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you wеre trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground


[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble


[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry

Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning

And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street

A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be

And now I see, now I see, now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey


[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Oh)
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Yeah)
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh (Yeah)
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble


[Bridge]
And the saddest fear
Comes creepin' in
That you never loved me
Or her or anyone or anything, yeah


[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (Never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (I knew it right there)
So, shame on me now (I knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (Whoa)
Now I'm lyin' on the cold, hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Oh)
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble (Trouble)

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble"

[Verse 1]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says


[Chorus]
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again


[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses

And the note that said


[Chorus]
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

Da-da-da-da

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

'Cause our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

In the front seat of his car

[Verse 1]
It's 2 a.m. in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start

You say, ""It's in the past,"" you drive straight ahead
You're thinkin' that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said


[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I

Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live and I

Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would


[Verse 2]
It's 2 a.m. in my room

Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around


[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I

Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live and I

Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fighting for and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would


[Post-Chorus]
I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I
I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I
I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I (Hey)

You always knew how to push my buttons (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
You give me everything and nothin' (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come runnin' (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)

To stand back where you stood (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would

I wish you would, I wish you would (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)

[Verse 3]
2 a.m., here we are

See your face, hear my voice in the dark

We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide

But it made us turn right back around

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I

Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live and I

Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I

Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live and I

Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good

Wish you knew that

[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""

Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night


[Pre-Chorus]
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone


[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that

But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back



[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read


[Chorus]
Is, ""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song

Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

Oh, think of me, mmm
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night

[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed

The more I think about it now
The less I know

All I know is that you drove us
Off the road


[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay

Had me in the palm of your hand, then

Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back

Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)

All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was stay

Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been pickin' up the pieces
Of the mess you made

People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside

But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay

Had me in the palm of your hand, then

Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?

All you had to do was (Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay)

This was what you wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
But not like this
Not like this, not like this
Oh, all you had to do was

Had me in the palm of your hand, then

Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts

I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew

So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh



[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel

This love is difficult, but it's real

Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die


[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""

And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'

When your birthday passed and I didn't call

Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times

I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall



[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind

You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""

And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand


[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""

And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly

Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall

Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all


[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red


[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
Loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)


[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong


[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red



[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)


[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red


[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met

[Verse 1]
I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized
By freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied


[Pre-Chorus]
But now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd

I'm reachin' for you, terrified


[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A mеssage in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' herе, hopin' it gets to you

[Verse 2]
These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me, made me
But time moves faster
Replayin' your laughter, disaster



[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now, you're so far away and I'm down
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified, 'cause


[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I (Ah)
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (At)
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

[Bridge]
How is it in London? (London)

Where were you while I'm wonderin' (Wonderin')
If I'll ever see you again?
You could be the one that I love, mm-mm
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love (Yeah, yeah)
I could be the one that you dream of (Of)
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (I can't sleep at night)
A message in a bottle is all I can do (Yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me

So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way


[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
There's nothin' stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be


[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


[Bridge]
And if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health


[Chorus]

'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard

I really, really hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 1: Matt Berninger]
I get myself twisted in threads

To meet you at The Alcott

I'd go to the corner in the back

Where you'd always be
And there you are, sittin' as usual
With your golden notebook

Writin' something about someone
Who used to be me

[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Taylor Swift, Matt Berninger]
And the last thing you wanted
Is the first thing I do
I tell you my problems
You tell me the truth
It's the last thing you wanted
It's the first thing I do
I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love with you


[Verse 2: Matt Berninger, Taylor Swift, Both]
I sit there silently
Waitin' for you to look up (Ah)
I see you smile
When you see it's me
I had to do something
To break into your golden thinking
 (Ah)

How many times will I do this
And you'll still believe? (Ah)


[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
It's the last thing you wanted
(Tell me, which side are you on, dear?)
It's the first thing you do
(Give me some tips to forget you)
You tell me your problems
(Have I become one of your problems?)

And I tell you the truth
(Could it be easy this once?)
It's the last thing you wanted
(Everything that's mine is a landmine)

It's the first thing I do
(Did my love aid and abet you?)

I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love with you

[Bridge: Matt Berninger, Taylor Swift]
And I'll ruin it all over
I'll ruin it for you
I'll ruin it all over
And over like I always do (Why don't you)

I'll ruin it all over (Rain on my parade?)

I'll ruin it for you (Shred my evening gown)
I'll ruin it all over (Read my sentence out loud)

And over like I always do ('Cause I love this curse on our house)



[Chorus: Matt Berninger & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
It's the last thing I wanted
(Tell me, which side are you on, dear?)
It's the first thing I do
(Give me some tips to forget you)
I tell you my problems
(Have I become one of your problems?)

And you tell me the truth
(Could it be easy this once?)
It's the last thing I wanted
(Everything that's mine is a landmine)

It's the first thing I do
(Did my love aid and abet you?)

I tell you that I think I'm fallin'

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards

You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch

Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea

You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good

And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile



[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show


[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much

And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands

And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand


[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it


[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away

I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay

And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along

Forever going with the flow
But you're friction



[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know

Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again

You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then

Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh

Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh

If you're anything like me,
You bite your nails,
And laugh when you're nervous.
You promise people the world,
because that's what they want from you.

You like giving them what they want...
But darling, you need to stop,


If you're anything like me,
You knock on wood every time you make plans.
You cross your fingers, hold your breath,

Wish on lucky numbers and eyelashes

Your superstitions were the lone survivors of the shipwreck.

Rest In Peace, to your naive bravado...
If life gets too good now,
Darling, it scares you.


If you're anything like me,
You never wanted to lock your door,
Your secret garden gate or your diary drawer

Didn't want to face the you you don't know anymore

For fear she was much better before...
But Darling, now you have to.

If you're anything like me,
There's a justice system in your head
For names you'll never speak again,
And you make your ruthless rulings.

Each new enemy turns to steel
They become the bars that confine you,
In your own little golden prison cell...

But Darling, there is where you meet yourself.


If you're anything like me
You've grown to hate your pride
To love your thighs

And no amount of friends at 25
Will fill the empty seats
At the lunch tables of your past
The teams that picked you last...
But Darling, you keep trying.


If you're anything like me,
You couldn't recognize the face of your love
Until they stripped you of your shiny paint
Threw your victory flag away
And you saw the ones who wanted you anyway...

Darling, later on you will thank your stars
for that frightful day.


If you're anything like me,
I'm sorry.

But Darling, it's going to be okay."

And she's got everything that I have to live without

I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see

He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar

Can he tell that I can't breathe?

And there he goes, so perfectly

So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better

And I feel perfectly fine


[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you

Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait

And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father

He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable

But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you

Breaking down and coming undone

And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all

And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated

Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you

Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you, oh, oh

Better Than Revenge (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha
Haha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him

She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""sabotage""

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it

I underestimated just who I was dealing with (Oh)
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum

She underestimated just who she was stealin' from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge), ha

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me

That no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

(Think about what you did)


[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Haha)

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word

Woah
Come on, can you take it back? Come on

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think (No)
She's an actress, woah (You know that you deserve this)
He was a moth to the flame
She was holding the matches, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge


[Outro]
(Come on) Do you still feel like you know what you're doin'?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doin'? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
(Oh, oh) Come on, show me how much better you are (So much better, yeah?)
So you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better

She took him faster than you could say ""sabotage"""

Reputation [Prologue] Lyrics
The Reputation Prologue is the introduction to reputation, and is featured on the first page of both the CD booklet and in the Target-exclusive magazines. Here, Taylor talks about the different ways a person… Read More 
Here's something I've learned about people.

We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them they have chosen to show us.
 We know our friend in a certain light, but we don't know them the way their lover does. Just the way their lover will never know them the same way that you do as their friend. Their mother knows them differently than their roommate, who knows them differently than their colleague. Their secret admirer looks at them and sees an elaborate sunset of brilliant color and dimension and spirit and pricelessness. And yet, a stranger will pass that person and see a faceless member of the crowd, nothing more. We may hear rumors about a person and believe those things to be true. We may one day meet that person and feel foolish for believing baseless gossip.


This is the first generation that will be able to look back on their entire life story documented in pictures on the internet, and together we will all discover the after-effects of that. Ultimately, we post photos online to curate what strangers think of us. But then we wake up, look in the mirror at our faces and see the cracks and scars and blemishes, and cringe. We hope someday we'll meet someone who will see that same morning face and instead see their future, their partner, their forever. Someone who will still choose us even when they see all of the sides of the story, all the angles of the kaleidoscope that is you.

The point being, despite our need to simplify and generalize absolutely everyone and everything in this life, humans are intrinsically impossible to simplify. We are never just good or just bad. We are mosaics of our worst selves and our best selves, our deepest secrets and our favorite stories to tell at a dinner party, existing somewhere between our well-lit profile photo and our drivers license shot. We are all a mixture of our selfishness and generosity, loyalty and self-preservation, pragmatism and impulsiveness. I've been in the public eye since I was 15 years old.
 On the beautiful, lovely side of that, I've been so lucky to make music for living and look out into crowds of loving, vibrant people. On the other side of the coin, my mistakes have been used against me, my heartbreaks have been used as entertainment, and my songwriting has been trivialized as 'oversharing'.


When this album comes out, gossip blogs will scour the lyrics for the men they can attribute to each song, as if the inspiration for music is as simple and basic as a paternity test.
 There will be slideshows of photos backing up each incorrect theory, because it's 2017 and if you didn't see a picture of it, it couldn't have happened right?


Let me say it again, louder for those in the back...


We think we know someone, but the truth is that we only know the version of them that they have chosen to show us.

There will be no further explanation

There will be just reputation."

Run (Taylor’s Version) [From the Vault] Lyrics
[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Give me the keys, I'll bring the car back around
We shouldn't be in this town

And my so-called friends, they don't know
I'd drive away before I let you go

So give me a reason and don't say no, no


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
There's a chain 'round your throat, piece of paper where I wrote

""I'll wait for you""
There's a key on the chain, there's a picture in a frame

Take it with you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
And run like you'd run from the law

Darling, let's run

Run from it all

We can go where our eyes can take us

Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run



[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift]
So you laugh like a child

And I'll sing like no one cares
No one to be and no one to tell
I could see this view a hundred times
Pale blue sky reflected in your eyes
So give me a reason and don't say no, no

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
And the note from the locket, you keep it in your pocket

Since I gave it to you
There's a heart on your sleeve
, I'll take it when I leave
And hold it for you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
And run like you'd run from the law

Darling, let's run

Run from it all
We can go like they're trying to chase us
Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run


[Bridge: Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift]
There's been this hole in my heart
This thing was a shot in the dark

Say you'll never let 'em tear us apart
And I'll hold onto you while we run
(And we run and we run and we run)



[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran, Taylor Swift]
Like you'd run from the law

(And we run and we run and we run)
Darling, let's run

(And we run and we run and we run)
Run from it all
(And we run and we run and we run)

We can go where our eyes can take us

Go where no one else is, run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, we'll run
Ooh, and we'll run"

Fifteen Lyrics
In “Fifteen,” Taylor looks back at her freshman year at Hendersonville High. Taylor wrote the song about her best friend, Abigail Anderson, who she met during ninth grade and is still best friends with.
[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say ""hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town

Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""


[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them

And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be

Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends

Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool

We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'

And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends



[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen


[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried


[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall

I've found time can heal most anything

And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen


[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

[Outro]
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"

[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line

I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet

And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold


[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted


[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you

He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead



[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing


[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted


[Bridge]
I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted



[Outro]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it"

[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody]

Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better


[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
No reasons why
Just you and me

[Chorus: Both]

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list

This is the last time I'm asking you why

You break my heart in the blink of an eye (Eye, eye)

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better



[Pre-Chorus: Both]
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast

Nowhere to hide
Just you and me

[Chorus: Both]

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list

This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
 (Eye, eye)

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Gary Lightbody & Both]

This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

[Chorus: Both]

This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye


[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Gary Lightbody]

This is the last time I'm asking you this (This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list (Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why (This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart in the blink of an eye (You break my heart)

This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this"

Picture to Burn (Original Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay

By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just anothеr picture to burn


[Verse 2]
There's no timе for tears, I'm just sittin' here planning my revenge
There's nothin' stoppin' me from goin' out with all of your best friends
And if you come around sayin' sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show ya how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


[Bridge]
And if you're missin' me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause comin' back around here would be bad for your health


[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time

In case you haven't heard
I really, really hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lyin'
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

You're just another picture to burn

[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight


[Pre-Chorus]
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart

And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

[Post-Chorus]
Never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots


[Pre-Chorus]
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school

[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred

And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone

[Verse 3]
So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on



[Chorus]
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
Won't let no one break your heart

And even though you want to
Please, try to never grow up

Oh, oh (Never grow up)
Don't you ever grow up
Oh (Never grow up)
Just never grow up"

Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's comin' back around

And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

'Cause karma is my boyfriend

Promise that you'll never endeavor with none lesser (Ever, ever)

Ask me what I earned from all those tears

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


[Verse 1]
And so it goes

Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through

I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell

Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture

They don't know how much I miss you

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky

I miss you like it was the very first night


[Verse 2]
And so it was
We never saw it comin'
Not trying to fall in love

But we did like children runnin'

Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart

We broke the status quo

Then we broke each other's hearts

[Pre-Chorus]
But don't forget about the night out in LA

Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway

No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you


[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Post-Chorus]
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you



[Bridge]
I remember the night at the hotel
I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper

""Do you know how much I miss you?""

[Breakdown]
I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
""I miss you like it was the very first night""

[Chorus]
I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night

[Post-Chorus]
Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)
Take me away (Take me) to you, to you
Take me away (Take me), take me away (Take me)
Take me away (Take me) to you, to you"

[Verse 1]
It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news

You're screaming inside and frozen in time

You did all that you could do

The game was rigged, the ref got tricked

The wrong ones think they’re right

You were outnumbered this time

But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
Can run
Can run
So run, and run, and run

So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be

And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget


[Pre-Chorus]
They aren't gonna help us

Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this

We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun

[Verse 1]
New to town with a made-up name

In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool

So overnight, you look like a sixties queen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky


[Chorus 1]
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


[Verse 2]
Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views

And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used

And all the young things line up to take your place



[Pre-Chorus 2]
Another name goes up in lights

You wonder if you’ll make it out alive


[Chorus 1]
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


[Verse 3]
It was a few years later, I showed up here

And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out

They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now


[Pre-Chorus 3]
'Cause now, my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right


[Chorus 2]
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
And they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one

[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to

As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known


[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale

I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around


[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know


[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around



[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale

I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now

And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now"

What about your promises, promises?
What about your promises, promises, promises? No


[Verse 1]
What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah

Big mistake, you broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made


[Pre-Chorus]
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it

You said, ""No one else""

How could you do this, babe?

[Chorus]
(What about your promises, promises?)
You really blew this, babe
We ain't getting through this one, babe

Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah

And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent

Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe

I break down every time you call

We're a wreck, you're the wrecking ball

We said, ""No one else""

You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy


[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here


[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew



[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall

And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (Missing)
And that was the moment I knew

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?

You should've been here
And I would've been so happy

And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""

And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""


[Chorus]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree

Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me

Just two kids, you and I
Oh, my, my, my, my

Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see

And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""



[Chorus]
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
2 AM riding in your truck
And all I need is you next to me

Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light
Oh, my, my, my, my


[Bridge]
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town

And you looked at me, got down on one knee


[Chorus]
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too

Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch

After all this time, you and I

We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

We both wake in lonely beds, different cities

How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

And this is when the feeling sinks in

Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today

I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all

And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant

Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me

I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you

God smiles on my little brother, inside and out

There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs

And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

And now, I know why all the trees change in the fall

I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes

For staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say

I don't think you're ready for this 'cause my body's too bootylicious for you, babe
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this jelly
I don't think you're ready for this 'cause my body's too bootylicious for you, babe

[The Treblemakers]
I like big butts and I cannot lie
(No lie)
You other brothers can't deny
(I won't)
When a girl walks in
With her itty bitty waist
And a round thing in your face
You get sprung
Wanna pull out your tongue
You know what matters
Courtship and chivalry
I'll take you to a nice hot meal and I'll tip the waiter



[Tone Hangers]
I went skydiving
I went rocky mountain climbing
I went two point seven seconds on a bull named Fu Man Chu
And I loved deeper
And I spoke sweeter

[The Barden Bellas]
I dug my key into the side
Of his pretty little souped-up four-wheel drive
Carved my name into his leather seats
I took a Louisville slugger to both head lights
I slashed a hole in all four tires
Maybe next time he'll think before he cheats

[Das Sound Machine]
Making my way downtown
Walking fast
Faces pass
And I'm homebound

[The Barden Bellas]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends
Talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together



[Tone Hangers]
Oh, what's love got to do, got to do with it
What's love but a second hand emotion
What's love got to do, got to do with it
Who needs a heart when a heart can be broken

[Das Sound Machine]
This is how we do it
I'm kinda buzzed and it's all because
This is how we do it
South Central does it like nobody does
This is how we do it
To all my neighbors you got much flavor
This is how we do it

[The Barden Bellas]
Girls you know you'd better watch out
Some guys, some guys are only about
That thing, that thing, that thing

[Das Sound Machine]
That girl is poison
Never trust a big butt and smile
That girl is poison

[The Barden Bellas]
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go, yo, here we go, yo
So what, so what, so what's the scenario?
Here we go

[Das Sound Machine]
Insane in the membrane (Insane in the brain)
Insane in the membrane (Insane in the brain)

[The Barden Bellas]
I got all I need when I got you and I
I look around me, and see sweet life
I'm stuck in the dark, but you're my flashlight
You're getting me
Getting me through the night"

“Speak Now” transports listeners to Taylor’s daydream where she crashes her ex’s wedding so he won’t be stuck with a girl who doesn’t treat him right. It’s rumored to be inspired by Hayley Williams of… Read More 
[Verse 1]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""


[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be


[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen

But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""

Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""


[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you



[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha


[Chorus]
So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, ""Speak now""

And you say, ""Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"""

[Verse 1]
We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shinin' bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back

We snuck into the circus

You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday

And we were happy

[Verse 2]
We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water

That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy


[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

[Post-Chorus]
We were happy

[Bridge]
Oh, I hate those voices
Tellin' me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were happy
We were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me

And we were happy

[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die


[Chorus]
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night
""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you

Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call

Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall



[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind

You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile

So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand


[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Chorus]
I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing

Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night out the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince


[Chorus]
And I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


[Verse 2]
He said, “Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""



[Chorus]
Like, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

Ooh-ooh, he's talking crazy
Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

Oh, my, what a marvelous tune
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing

The street looks when it's just rained

There's a glow off the pavement

You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah

Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fеarless

So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this onе-horse town, I wanna stay right here

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way
But you pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
It's fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something

I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?

'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now, you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing

Here's to silence that cuts me to the core

Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
You didn't mean it, baby, I don't think so

Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

Given to a perfect day
Just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

You put up walls and paint them all a shade of gray

And I stood there loving you and wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a dreamer with the nerve to adore you

Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending

So just walk away, ain't no use defending
Words that you will never say

You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
If I died, died for you, died for you

Given to a perfect day, oh
Every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you

It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes, down to my skin

Lost in the gray and I try to grab at the fray

'Cause I, I still love you, but I can't

Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side

Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing

The picture frame is empty

On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash

Guess I never doubted it

Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past

You Belong With Me (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's goin' off about something that you said

'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night

I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like

And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time


[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You bеlong with me, you belong with me


[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench, thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town

I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down

You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?


[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time


[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standin' by and waitin' at your back door

All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you
Driving to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry

I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see? (Ah)
You belong with me
Standin' by and waitin' at your back door

All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought, just maybe you belong with me?
You belong with me"

[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic

But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm

Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights

Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too


[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""

Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true



[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm

There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue

And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah


[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home

Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)


[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you"

[Verse 1]
I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man

And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy

Remember I leaned in and whispered to you


[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here

You were my best four years""


[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here

I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear



[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here

You were my best four years""


[Bridge]
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here

You were my best four years

I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back"

[Verse 1]
Last night, I heard my own heart beating
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reaching
Even though I know you're not there
I was playing back a thousand memories, baby
Thinking 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you


[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now


[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen

But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends were laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street

Flashback to the night when you said to me
That nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose



[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now


[Bridge]
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door


[Breakdown]
And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out
But I take it all back now""


[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now



[Outro]
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now

Baby, what about the ending?
Oh, I thought you'd be here by now
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thought you'd be here by now"

[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed

This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said


[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me

But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing

And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay


[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams

I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life


[Breakdown]
Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Chorus]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

[Outro]
Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 1]
The first shot's fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, that's not what happened at all
There's no sound, I'm waiting on your next move
A showdown and I know where to hit you
But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now we're fighting dirty
Won't somebody come say, ""Break it up""?


[Chorus]

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle

And why you taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side

But if you wanna fight
Baby, let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh


[Verse 2]
So gloves off, if this is how you want it
We had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise
No, no, I'm not the one who tore us apart
Let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine
Is she here? Is she standing on the sidelines?
Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breaking my heart?


[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're standing in the ring
And you make the first swing
And now I'm fighting dirty
But I ain't going down ‘til they break it up

[Chorus]
And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle

And why you taking shots at me like
Somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side

But if you wanna fight
Let's go, oh, oh
Let's go, oh, oh


[Bridge]
Now we're standing in the ring
Breaking everything that we've been building up so long
And I don't wanna do this, break it up
But you're not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
Looks like we're going to war

[Chorus 2]

And I used to be on your side
Now it's looking like we're going to battle

And I'm trying not to break down crying
No one's gonna give you a medal
And I never wanna hurt you
But I'm tired of taking all these blows
And so I'd rather be on your side

I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight
Baby, let's go, oh, oh
Looks like we're going to war
Oh, oh

[Verse 1: John Mayer]
I was born in the arms of imaginary friends

Free to roam, made a home out of everywhere I've been
Then you come crashing in, like the realest thing
Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring

[Chorus: John Mayer & Taylor Swift, John Mayer]
Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (Can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart

[Verse 2: John Mayer]
I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, 'til the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring


[Chorus: John Mayer & Taylor Swift, John Mayer]
Oh, half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you (Can't keep loving you)
Oh, with half of my heart
With half of my heart


[Verse 3: John Mayer, Taylor Swift]
Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you

I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
With half of my—

[Chorus: John Mayer & Taylor Swift, John Mayer]
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart's got a real good imagination
Half of my heart's got you
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you that
Half of my heart won't do

[Outro: John Mayer, John Mayer & Taylor Swift]
Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring

And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything

Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart
Oh, half of my heart
Half of my heart"

He
 is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear
And it's like I couldn't ask for anything better

[Pre-Chorus]
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight""

And I feel perfectly fine


[Chorus]
But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain

And it's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name

So in love that you act insane

And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and comin' undone

It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush

And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He respects my space
And never makes me wait

And he calls exactly when he says he will

He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father

He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable



[Chorus]
But I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain

And it's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name

So in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breakin' down and comin' undone

It's a, a rollercoaster kind of rush

And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

He can't see the smile I'm fakin'

And my heart's not breakin'
'Cause I'm not feelin' anything at all

And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating, intoxicatin', complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

I miss screamin' and fightin' and kissin' in the rain

It's 2 AM and I'm cursin' your name

So in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you

'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way

People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift with Colbie Caillat]
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down

Now, I don't know what to be without you around

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out

And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me

And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me

[Verse 1]
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory


[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted

Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts


[Verse 2]
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts



[Bridge]
And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into

And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts"

The water's high, you're jumping into it and letting go

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I wish I was strong enough
To lift not one but both of us
Someday I will be strong enough
To lift not one but both of us


[Verse 1: B.o.B, Taylor Swift]
Uh, ever thought about losin' it
When your money's all gone and you lose your whip
 (Ooh-ooh)
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence

Open up the fridge 'bout twenty times (Ooh-ooh)
But you still can’t find no food in it, that’s foolishness

And sometimes I wonder why we care so much about the way we look (Ooh-ooh)
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?

'Cause if life is an uphill battle (Ooh-ooh)
We all try to climb on the same old ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just askin'

What's the pattern to the madness? (Ooh-ooh)
Everybody in a number one draft pick
Most of us ain't Hollywood actors
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball (Ooh-ooh)
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all

I wish I was strong enough
To lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough
To lift not one but both of us

I could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle (Ooh-ooh)
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
For all the times no one’s ever spoke for us (Ooh-ooh)
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that, ""That’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us""

When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep

And you feel like you’re just another person (Ooh-ooh)
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds, uh

Because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up (Ooh-ooh)
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint

Then build it from the ground up
Hey, but if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all

To lift not one but both of us
Someday I will be strong enough
To lift not one but both of us

You can learn to fly and you can chase your dreams (Chase your dreams)
You can laugh and cry, but everybody knows (Everybody knows)
You’ll always find your way back home

Back home, where the real you is the superstar
Back home, you know it’s never too far away

[Intro]
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you

And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window

I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold

Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone


[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel

Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you

Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Verse 2]
Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same



[Chorus]
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Bridge]
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out

And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

[Breakdown]
Hey, Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha)


[Chorus]
I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else

Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Verse 1]
I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights

Busy streets and busy lives

And all we know is touch and go

We are alone with our changing minds

We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time


[Chorus]
And I never (I never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never (I'll never)
Be the same


[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball

Now all we know is don't let go

We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean

Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong

We learn to live with the pain, mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild



[Chorus]
And I never (I never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never (I'll never)
Be the same


[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight

Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right

These are the hands of fate

You're my Achilles heel

This is the golden age of somethin' good
And right and real


[Chorus]
And I never (I never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same, oh-oh-oh
And I never (I never)
Saw you comin'

I think... I think when it's all over it just comes back in flashes, you know?

It's like a kaleidoscope of memories, it just all comes back. But he never does.
I think part of me knew the second I saw him that this would happen.

It's not really anything he said or anything he did
It was the feeling that came along with it.
And the crazy thing is I don't know if I'm ever gonna feel that way again,
But I don't know if I should.

I knew his world moved too fast and burned too bright, but I just thought,
How can the devil be pulling you toward someone who looks so much like an angel when he smiles at you?

Maybe he knew that when he saw me.

I guess I just lost my balance.

I think that the worst part of it all wasn't losing him
It was losing me."

When I went looking for a reason, I know

I tried to take the road less traveled by
But nothing seems to work the first few times
Am I right?


[Chorus]
So how can I ever try to be better?
Nobody ever lets me in
I can still see you, this ain't the best view
On the outside looking in
I've been a lot of lonely places
I've never been on the outside

You saw me there, but never knew
That I would give it all up to be
A part of this, a part of you

And now, it's all too late, so you see

You could've helped if you had wanted to
But no one notices until it's too late to do anything

One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did

And my flight was awful, thanks for asking

I'm unglued, thanks to you

And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

[Verse 2: Lana Del Rey, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched ""aurora borealis green""

I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery

My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true

Now, it's like snow at the beach

Cory's eyes are like a jungle

He smiles, it's like the radio

He whispers songs into my window
In words that nobody knows

Saying, ""Does he know?""
Will you ever know?

You're beautiful, every little piece, love
Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?

And when you find everything you looked for
I hope your life leads you back to my door
Oh, but if it don't
Stay beautiful

Cory finds another way to be
The highlight of my day
I'm taking pictures in my mind
So I can save 'em for a rainy day

It's hard to make a conversation
When he's taking my breath away

Don't you know you're really gonna be someone?

Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like
Trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the freefall
Like the colors in autumn
So bright, just before they lose it all


[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red


[Verse 2]
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Burning, it was red

Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red

Burning red, burning red

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much

And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands

And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand


[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it


[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away

I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay

All we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along

Forever going with the flow
But you're friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it


[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you a— get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should— think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous

Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]

Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door

Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Spеak now""

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are еxchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be


[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen

But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""

There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you


[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha

[Chorus]
So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, ""Speak now""
And you say, ""Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"""

And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you

Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down

This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair

We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down

This revolution, the time will come

And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?

These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place

And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more

And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me

Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me



[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do

And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

And maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise

So casually cruel in the name of being honest

I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well



[Verse 4]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well"

22 (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night

To dress up like hipsters

And make fun of our exes

Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah

Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh


[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' twenty-two

Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will bе alright if
We just keep dancin' like we'rе
Twenty-two
Twenty-two


[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleepin'

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
(Hey)
I don't know about you
But I'm feelin' twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancin' like we're
Twenty-two (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
Twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two
Twenty-two (Ooh)



[Post-Chorus]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you


[Bridge]
Ooh, oh
Yeah, hey, yeah


[Chorus]
(Hey)
I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feelin' twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh, oh-oh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancin' like we're (Dance like we're twenty-two)
Twenty-two (Ooh, woah-oh-oh-oh)
Twenty-two (Dancin' like)
Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah)
Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah, yeah)


[Post-Chorus]
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you"

[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down

And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around


[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)


[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know

Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)



[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no

You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade


[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
You're not sorry (No, no, no, no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)

I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
'Cause I'm still trying to figure it out

Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking

Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world


[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans

And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
Feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need?
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh, yeah
But that's okay

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on

Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

Maybe I'm just a girl on a mission
But I'm ready to fly

I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh, but life goes on
Oh, I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know

Oh, I'm just a girl trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 1]
In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignoring words that you were saying
Tryin' to make me stay
I said, ""This time I've had enough""

And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not picking up


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so mad
I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer


[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles

Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""

Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more

And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door

[Verse 2]
Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone

Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door

And all the things that I misread


[Pre-Chorus]
So, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles

Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""

Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more

And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door

[Bridge]
And I'll scream out the window
""I can't even look at you""
""I don't need you,"" but I do, I do, I do
I'll say, ""There's nothing you can say""
""To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it""
What I mean is

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles

Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""

Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more

And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


[Outro]
With your face and the beautiful eyes

And the conversation with the little white lies

And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?

After everything and that little black dress

After everything, I must confess, I need you"

[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down


[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well

I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha


[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what wе do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room

And his voicе is a familiar sound

Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now



[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well

And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

Say you'll remember me

Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories

Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress

Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)

[Intro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that


[Verse 1]
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer and crossing so many lines


[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned


[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
""Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that""



[Verse 2]
I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly you're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing and take for granted what you have

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl

And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her


[Chorus]
So don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
""Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that""

Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)
Oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned


[Chorus]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, ah-ah
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Want to see you pick up your phone (Oh-oh-oh)
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Verse 1]
Tall, dark, and superman

He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition

I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, ""How are you?”
I say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever

[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down


[Verse 2]
Tall, dark and beautiful

He's complicated, he's irrational

But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say

And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day

I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday

I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

And I watch you fly around the world

And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window

Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day


[Chorus]
I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

Holy Ground (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While havin' coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away

Back to a first-glance feelin' on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme

Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day


[Chorus]
And darlin', it was good
Never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground


[Verse 2]
Spinnin' like a girl in a brand new dress

We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for thе first time, I had something to lose

And I guess we fell apart in the usual way

And the story's got dust on every page

But, sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now

And I see your face in every crowd



[Chorus]
'Cause, darlin', it was good (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
Never lookin' down (Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy)
And right there where we stood (Ooh-ayy)
Was holy ground


[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah
Ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, ooh-ayy, oh-woah

Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancin' with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancin' with you

It was good
I'm never lookin' down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

Come Back...Be Here (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all

Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus]
I told myself, ""Don't get attached""
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you


[Chorus]
And this is when the feelin' sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

I guess you're in New York today

I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

[Verse 2]
The delicate beginnin' rush
The feelin' you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all

And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


[Pre-Chorus]
Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you


[Chorus]
And this is when the feelin' sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here
Come back, be here

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is fallin' for you when you are worlds away

In New York, be here
But you're in London and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

This is when the feelin' sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here
Come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way

Back to December / Apologize / You’re Not Sorry (Live/2011) Lyrics
This track is a live version of “Back to December” that combines the original with two other songs, OneRepublic’s “Apologize” and “You’re Not Sorry.”. It was performed during the Speak Now World Tour in 2011.
[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life, tell me, how's your family
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die


[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night

And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall


[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night

And I'd go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain’t nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile, so good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand...

And then he said, ""It's too late to apologize""
It's too late...
He said, ""It's too late to apologize""
It's too late...



[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride (It's too late to apologize)
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night (It's too late)
And I go back to December (It's too late to apologize, it's too late)
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you (It's too late to apologize)
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine (It's too late)

Oh

[Outro]
He said you're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)
You're not sorry (no no no)

The Moment I Knew (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door

With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars that just align

And I would've been so happy
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waitin' for you to walk in
But the time is tickin'
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here


[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughin'
As I'm lookin' around the room
But therе was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knеw



[Verse 2]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's somethin' really wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feelin' starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""


[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughin'
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knew


[Bridge]
What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?

And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?



[Breakdown]
You should've been here
And I would've been so happy


[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standin' around me, singin'
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missin'
And that was the moment I knew


[Post-Chorus]
(Oh) Oh, I knew
(Oh)

[Outro]
You called me later
And said, ""I'm sorry I didn't make it""
And I said, ""I'm sorry too""
And that was the moment I knew"

[Verse 1: Tim McGraw]
Bet your window's rolled down and your hair's pulled back
And I bet you got no idea you're going way too fast
You're trying not to think about what went wrong
Trying not to stop 'til you get where you goin'
You're trying to stay awake so I bet you turn on the radio
And the song goes


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh, baby


[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do


[Verse 2: Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift]
I bet you got a dead cell phone in your shotgun seat

Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me

You're trying not to let the first tear fall out
You're trying not to think about turning around

You're trying not to get lost in the sound but that song is always on
So you sing along


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby


[Chorus: Tim McGraw]
The highway won't hold you tonight
The highway don't know you're alive
The highway don't care if you're all alone
But I do, I do
The highway won't dry your tears
The highway don't need you here
The highway don't care if you're coming home
But I do, I do

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby, oh baby


[Bridge: Tim McGraw & Taylor Swift]
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

The highway don't care
The highway don't care
But I do, I do
I can't live without you, I can't live without you, baby
I can't live without I can't live without you, baby, oh baby

The highway don't care
But I do, I do

[Verse 1]
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in

And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will

Skies grew darker

Currents swept you out again

And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

[Pre-Chorus]
In silent screams, in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this


[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)


[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
(Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]

Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on

Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind for only you

But you were still gone, gone, gone


[Pre-Chorus]
In losin' grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time


[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)

This love left a permanent mark

This love is glowing in the dark (Oh-oh-oh)

These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me, oh-oh-oh


[Post-Chorus]
(This love, this love, this love, this love) Oh-oh-oh
(This love, this love, this love, this love) Oh-oh-oh
(This love, this love, this love, this love) Oh-oh-oh
(This love, this love, this love, this love)

[Bridge]
Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees

When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need



[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)

(This love) This love left a permanent mark

(This love) This love is glowing in the dark (Oh-oh-oh)

(This love) These hands had to let it go free and

Sad Beautiful Tragic (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Long handwritten notes deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait


[Chorus]
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


[Verse 2]
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation

And we both wake in lonely beds and different cities

And time is taking its sweet time erasing you

And you've got your demons and, darlin', they all look like me


[Chorus]
'Cause wе had a beautiful, magic love therе
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair


[Post-Chorus]
Woah, woah, woah, oh

[Bridge]
Distance, timin', breakdown, fighting

Silence, the train runs off its tracks

Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?

Hang up, give up and, for the life of us, we can't get back


[Chorus]
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful
What we had, a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"

Untouchable like a distant diamond sky

I'm reachin' out and I just can't tell you why

I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun

And when you're close, I feel like comin' undone

In the middle of the night, when I'm in this dream

It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name

You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together

Come on, come on, little taste of Heaven

Oh, oh

It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're sayin' that you'd be here anyway

But you're untouchable, burnin' brighter than the sun
And now that you're close, I feel like comin' undone

It's like a million little stars spellin' out your name

You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together

Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night, wakin' from this dream

I wanna feel you by my side, standin' next to me
You gotta come on, come on, say that we'll be together

Was all fucking choke
And it ain't easier after a week
We're on a long byway standing

If I'll stay a spell, or if I cannot stay
I am less at ease, not the best at these
See the forest trees, call what's these what's these

The Best Day (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it's gettin' cold, I've got my big coat on

I hear your laugh and look up smilin' at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides, look, now the sky is gold

I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall

But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away

But I know I had the best day with you today


[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now and don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home cryin' and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names


[Chorus]
I don't know who I'm gonna talk to now at school

But I know I'm laughin' on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's gonna take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out, he's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you



[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talkin' to me

It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarves

Daddy's smart and you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world


[Chorus]
Now I know why all the trees change in the fall

I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for givin' me your eyes
For staying back and watchin' me shine
And I didn't know if you knew
So I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today"

The Other Side of the Door (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
In the heat of the fight, I walked away
Ignorin' words that you were sayin', tryna make me stay

I said, ""This time I've had enough""

And you've called a hundred times
But I'm not pickin' up


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm so mad, I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window, throwin' pebbles

Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door


[Verse 2]
Well, me and my stupid pride are sittin' here alone
Goin' through the photographs, starin' at the phone
I keep goin' back over things we both said
And I remember the slammin' door

And all the things that I misread


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles

Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door


[Bridge]
And I'll scream out the window
""I can't even look at you""
I don't need you, but I do, I do, I do
I say, ""There's nothin' you can say
To make this right again, I mean it, I mean it""
But what I mean is

[Chorus]
I said, ""Leave,"" but, baby, all I want is you
To stand outside my window throwin' pebbles

Screamin', ""I'm in love with you""
Wait there in the pourin' rain, comin' back for more
And don't you leave 'cause I know
All I need is on the other side of the door


[Outro]
With your face and the beautiful eyes

And the conversation with the little white lies

And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down cryin', was she worth this mess?

After everything and that little black dress

After everything, I must confess
I need you"

​cardigan (voice memo) Lyrics
So first of all, I'm obsessed with, like, pretty much all of these tracks, and it was really hard to figure out like what I wanted to write first because I had thoughts for all of them, so, unbelievable archives, I can't believe you have this just, like, laying around, that's ... ridiculous, these are unbelievable. But anyway, the first one that I... I was working something up for is the ""Maple"" one? And I came up with this thing, and it's probably gonna obviously like be sequencing differences like, you know, different lengths and different verses and whatever, but this is just like a rough, uh, thing. 

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing


[Chorus]
But I knew you
Living in a gold age
Sneaking to my bird cage, I

I knew you
Laughing like a damn fool

Breaking every damn rule, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Instrumental Break]
And then, I have like this-- there's like a break, because I don't really know what's gonna happen here, but I do have like a... I think it's here? Was where I was putting a-- a bridge thing. 

[Bridge]
And to kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
Now I'm bleedin'
I'm bleedin'

[Instrumental Break]
We'll work on that and not make it bad. And then, um, there's all this time, but when the, like, kind of major chorus comes back in, I wait 'til then, and then, I start singing again. I don't think it's right now, but... there it is. The ending. 


[Chorus]
I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter leaving Wendy, I
I knew you
Dancing in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
That when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a stolen kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs

The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
I knew I'd wish you would've changed your mind
I knew you'd miss me once the moment died
I knew to love would be to lose my mind

And then, I don't know. You let me know what you think. And, uh, that's just kind of like a rough idea of... something. Let me know if you like it."

[Verse 1]
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are


[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around

And here's to you and your temper

Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Verse 2]
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day

Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around

Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why


[Bridge]
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?


[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why)

I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know"

The Lucky One (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
New to town with a made-up name

In the angel's city, chasin' fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool

So overnight, you look like a '60s queen

[Pre-Chorus]
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

[Chorus]
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh


[Verse 2]
And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views

And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you

And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused

'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place



[Pre-Chorus]
Another name goes up in lights

You wonder if you'll make it out alive


[Chorus]
And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


[Verse 3]
It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out

They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right


[Chorus]
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one

[Intro]
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah

[Verse 1]
Hey Stephen, I know looks can be deceivin'
But I know I saw a light in you

And as we walked, we were talkin'
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window
I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold

Hey Stephen, boy, you might have me believin'
I don't always have to be alone

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel

Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so

Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you

Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Mm, mmm
Oh-woah, mmm

Hey Stephen, I've been holdin' back this feelin'
So I've got some things to say to you, huh
I've seen it all, so I thought

But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name

It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey Stephen, why are people always leavin'?
I think you and I should stay the same

'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so

Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

They're dimming the street lights
You're perfect for me
Why aren't you here
 tonight?
I'm waitin' alone now
So come on and come out
And pull me near
And shine, shine, shine

Hey Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? Haha

I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so

Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else

Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain, so

Come feel this magic I've been feelin' since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

[Outro]
Oh-oh, myself
Mmm, I can't help myself
I can't help myself, oh-oh-oh
Mmm, mmm

Enchanted (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy

Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you

All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home

I'll spеnd forever wonderin' if you knеw
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up

2 a.m., who do you love?

I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say

""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends

My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again

These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you

Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you (Oh-oh)

[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


[Outro]
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waitin' on you"

Gasoline (Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1: HAIM]
You took me back
But you shouldn't have
Now it's your fault if I mess around
I took a drag
But I shouldn't have
Now I'm coughin' up like I never smoked a pack

[Chorus: HAIM]
Gasoline, pretty please
I wanna get off
But you're such a tease
Throw the keys back to me
Go on and kick off your boots
In the passenger seat


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I get sad
You know I get sad
And I can't look past what I'm sad about
You did me bad (Did me bad, did me bad)
And I did it back (Did it back, did it back)
You needed it as well, what's wrong with that?

[Chorus: HAIM, Taylor Swift, HAIM & Taylor Swift]
Gasoline (Gasoline), pretty please (Pretty please)
I wanna get off (Gasoline)
But you're such a tease

Throw the keys (Throw the keys) back to me (Back to me)
Go on and kick off your boots (Gasoline)
In the passenger seat



[Bridge: HAIM, Taylor Swift, HAIM & Taylor Swift]
(Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow)
We're watchin' the sunrise from the kitchen counter
(I want you bad, want you bad, don't you know?)
When you're lying between my legs, it doesn't matter
(Strike a match, strike a match, watch it blow)
You say you wanna go slower, but I wanna go faster
(I want you bad, want you bad)
Faster and faster

[Outro: HAIM]
Gasoline, pretty please
I wanna get off
But you're such a tease"

Begin Again (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do

Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do


[Verse 2]
I walked in, expectin' you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave, I walk to you

You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do


[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spendin' the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wеdnesday in a café, I watched it begin again


[Verse 3]
You said you nеver met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do

We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy, but I do


[Chorus]
But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spendin' the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again



[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past


[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spendin' the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again


[Outro]
On a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Sayin', ""This is it, I've had enough""

'Cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month

When you said you needed space, what?

Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""

Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, we called it off again last night, but
Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you


[Chorus]
We are never, evеr, ever gettin' back togеther
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together


[Post-Chorus]
Like, ever


[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you pickin' fights
And me fallin' for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine (Haha)



[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, this time, I'm tellin' you, I'm tellin' you (Oh)

[Chorus]
We (We) are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ever) gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Yeah), ooh (Yeah)
Ooh (Yeah), oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's, like, ""I still love you""
And I'm, like, I'm just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together
Like, ever (No)

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
We are never, ever, ever (Oh) gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (To me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together


[Outro]
We (Ooh), no
Gettin' back together (Ooh)
We (Ooh), oh
Gettin' back together (Ooh), yeah
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together"

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way

People are people and sometimes we change our minds

But it's killin' me to see you go after all this time

[Break: Taylor Swift]
Mm, mmm
Mm, mmm

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]
The music starts playin' like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of endin' you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down

Now I don't know what to be without you around


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat, Taylor Swift]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat, Taylor Swift]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


[Verse 3: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat]
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve

But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout



[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat, Taylor Swift]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat, Taylor Swift]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat, Taylor Swift]
It's 2 AM, feelin' like I just lost a friend

Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 AM, feelin' like I just lost a friend

Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat, Taylor Swift]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
Woah

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat, Taylor Swift]
I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to


[Outro: Taylor Swift & Colbie Caillat, Taylor Swift]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm), I'm sorry (Yeah, yeah), I'm sorry
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Ooh), I'm sorry"

Fifteen (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while

Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here

For the next four years in this town

Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say

""You know, I haven't seen you around before""


[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them

And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be

At fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends

Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can

And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'

And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends

When the night ends


[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin around, well
In your life you'll do things greater than
Datin' the boy on the football team
I didn't know it at fifteen


[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted

Wish you could go back
And tell yourself what you know now


[Verse 3]
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried


[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them

And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall

But I've found time can heal most anything

And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen


[Post-Chorus]
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la

[Outro]
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"

Speak Now [Liner Notes] Lyrics
Prologue


'Speak now or forever hold your peace,' the words said by preachers at the end of wedding ceremonies all over the world, right before the vows. It's a last chance for protest, a moment that makes everyone's heart race, and a moment I've always been strangely fascinated by. So many fantasize about bursting into a church, saying what they'd kept inside for years like in the movies. In real life, it rarely happens.


Real life is a funny thing, you know.
 In real life, saying the right thing at the right moment is beyond crucial. So crucial, in fact, the most of us start to hesitate, for fear of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. But lately what I've begun to fear more than that is letting the moment pass without saying anything.

I think most of us fear reaching the end of our life, and looking back regretting the moments we didn't speak up. When we didn't say 'I love you.' When we should've said 'I'm sorry.' When we didn't stand up for ourselves or someone who needed help.

These songs are made up of words I didn’t say when the moment was right in front of me. These songs are open letters. Each is written with a specific person in mind, telling them what I meant to tell them in person. To the beautiful boy whose heart I broke in December.
 To my first love who I never thought would be my first heartbreak.
 To my band.
 To a mean man I used to be afraid of.
 To someone who made my world very dark for a while.
 To a girl who stole something of mine.
 To someone I forgive for what he said in front of the whole world.


Words can break someone into a million pieces, but they can also put them back together. I hope you use yours for good, because the only words you’ll regret more than the ones left unsaid are the ones you use to intentionally hurt someone.


What you say might be too much for some people. Maybe it will come out all wrong and you’ll stutter and you’ll walk away embarrassed, wincing as you play it all back in your head. But I think the words you stop yourself from saying are the ones that will haunt you the longest.

So say it to them. Or say it to yourself in the mirror. Say it in a letter you’ll never send or in a book millions might read someday.
 I think you deserve to look back on your life without a chorus of resounding voices saying ‘I could’ve, but it’s too late now.’

There is a time for silence. There is a time waiting your turn. But if you know how you feel, and you so clearly know what you need to say, you’ll know it.


I don't think you should wait. I think you should speak now.

Love, Taylor

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming

It's been a long time coming
It's been a long time coming

(What if I told you I'm back?)
(It's fearless; It's you and me)
It's been a long time coming

(Big reputation)
It's been a long time coming

(And they said, ""Speak now"")
It's been a long time coming

(Into folklore)
(My name is Taylor and I was born in 1989)

(Straight from the tortured poets department)

It's been a long time coming

(Hey)
It's been a long time coming

(Evermore)
(Lovin' him was red)
It's been a long time coming

(Red, red; It's you and me)
It's been a long time coming

[Verse 1]
I bet, this time of night, you're still up
I bet you're tired from a long, hard week
I bet you're sittin' in your chair by the window lookin' out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder 'bout me


[Chorus]
And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you

And I wish I could run to you

And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do
I almost do


[Verse 2]
I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
'Cause each time you reach out, there's no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can't say hello to you and risk another goodbye

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that
Every time I don't, I almost do

Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It's probably better off this way

And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you're touchin' my face

And asking me if I'd wanna try again with you
And I almost do

And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you

And I wish I could run to you
And I hope you know that

[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered ""have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette starts to make it's way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks like passing notes in secrecy
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Oh, Taylor, I was so enchanted to meet you too


[Chorus]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too


[Verse 2]
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wondered till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth, wishing you were at my door

Oh, Taylor, I was so enchanted to meet you too

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

[Bridge]
This is me praying that this was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name until I see you again
These are the words I held back as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you too
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you


[Chorus]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
Taylor I'll spend my whole life wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you too



[Outro]
I was never in love with someone else
I never had somebody waiting on me
'Cause you were all of my dreams come true
And I just wish you knew
Taylor, I was so in love with you"

Clean (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore


[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm


[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean


[Verse 2]
There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turnеd to dust that covered my whole room

So I punchеd a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah

Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you


[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud, but no one heard a thing



[Chorus]
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

[Post-Chorus]
I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Said I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it


[Break]
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

[Chorus]
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean


[Outro]
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Think I'm finally clean"

[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known


[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale

I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around


[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes

And never really had a chance
Well, my mistakе, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have thе upper hand


[Pre-Chorus]
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, well now I know



[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale

I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around


[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me

Just like I always wanted

But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale

I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well

This is a big world, that was a small town

There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

[Outro]
Oh, woah, woah, woah
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now"

Dear John (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you

Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again

And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain

And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day

Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight

Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why


[Chorus]
Dear John,
 I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known


[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""



[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?

I shoulda known


[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
You are an expert at ""Sorry"" and keepin' lines blurry

Never impressed by me acing your tests

All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes

'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
Oh


[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shoulda known



[Outro]
You shoulda known
Don't you think I was too young?

[Intro: Taylor Swift]
(I'm the problem, it's me)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)


[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
(Always rooting for the anti-hero)

[Verse 2: Jack Antonoff]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is an art bro lately

And I just judge them on the hill
Too hurt to hang out, talking shit about your famous baby
Pierced through the heart of '90s guilt

Maybe I'm the problem, it's me

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(Taylor, you'll be fine)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)


[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Jack Antonoff, Both]
It's me (Me), hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


[Post-Chorus: Jack Antonoff]
Always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown: Both, Jack Antonoff, Taylor Swift]
I'm the problem, it's me
(Taylor)
(I'm the problem, it's me)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Jack Antonoff]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Outro: Jack Antonoff, Taylor Swift, Both]
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero
Always rooting for the anti-hero"

[Verse 1]
Do you remember
The 28th night of September?

Love was changin' the minds of pretenders

While chasin' the clouds away
Our hearts were ringin'
In the key that our souls were singin'
As we danced in the night, remember
How the stars stole the night away

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day

[Verse 2]
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love

Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now, December found the love that we shared in September
Only blue talk and love

Remember the love that we share today

[Chorus]
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, never was a cloudy day
Ahh-ahh-ahh
Hey, say that you remember
Ai, ai, dancin' in September
Ai, ai, golden dreams were shiny days

[Verse 1]
I like the way you sound in the morning
We're on the phone and without a warning
I realize your laugh is the best sound
I have ever heard

I like the way I can't keep my focus
I watch you talk, you didn't notice

I hear the words but all I can think is
""We should be together""


[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you smile, I smile

And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall

[Verse 2]
Well, I like the way your hair falls in your face

You got the keys to me, I love each freckle on your face, oh

I've never been so wrapped up, honey
I like the way you're everything I ever wanted
I had time to think it oh-over
And all I can say is, ""Come closer""
Take a deep breath and jump, then fall into me


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause every time you smile, I smile

And every time you shine, I'll shine for you

[Chorus]
Woah-oh, I'm feelin' you, baby
Don't be afraid to jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall

[Bridge]
The bottom's gonna drop out from under our feet
I'll catch you, I'll catch you
When people say things that bring you to your knees
I'll catch you

The time is gonna come when you're so mad you could cry
But I'll hold you through the night until you smile

[Chorus]
Woah-oh, I need you, baby
Don't be afraid, please, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me
Baby, I'm never gonna leave you
Say that you wanna be with me too
'Cause I'ma stay through it all
So, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall, baby
Jump, then fall into me, into me


[Outro]
Every time you smile, I smile
And every time you shine, I'll shine
And every time you're here
Baby, I'll show you, I'll show you
You can jump, then fall, jump, then fall
Jump, then fall into me, into me, yeah"

Mine (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Intro]

Ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah-ah, ah-ah

[Verse 1]
You were in college working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts


[Pre-Chorus]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch

The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

You are the best thing that's ever been mine


[Verse 2]
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded

You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes



[Pre-Chorus]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands

I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause it's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone"" (Oh)


[Chorus]
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you believe it? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
We're gonna make it now (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
And I can see it (Yeah, yeah)
I can see it now"

Blank Space (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin

Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand

I can make the bad guys good for a weekend


[Chorus]

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth thе pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tеll you I'm insane

'Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies

I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month

Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn

Rose garden filled with thorns

Keep you second guessin', like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream


[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya


[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)

'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (Love the game)
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)

And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye

And we caught onto somethin'
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kiddin'?

'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause, one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door


[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all

And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always,"" oh

Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide

Like a scared little boy?

I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure

So here's to everything coming down to nothin'

Here's to silence that cuts me to the core

Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all

And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always,"" oh

Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

You didn't mean it, baby

I don't think so
Oh, woah

[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all

Long Live (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age


[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashеd through

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

I was scrеaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishin' for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown

When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world


[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid

Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye

If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name

Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you


[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you

And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"

[Verse 1]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh, oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is, ""No""
You never saw it comin', slipped when you started runnin'

And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I


[Pre-Chorus]
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh, ayy
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better, someday, you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever
 and

[Chorus]
There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""

Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

[Verse 2]
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh, oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it comin', you hit the ground runnin'
And now you're on to somethin', I, I, I say

[Pre-Chorus]
""What a sight, what a sight"" when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And, in this perfect weather, it's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


[Chorus]
There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction (Woah)
There you'll stand, next to me (Next to me)
All at once, the rest is history

Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction (Woah; Sweeter than fiction)

[Bridge]
I'll be one of the many sayin'
""Look at you now, look at you now and now""
I'll be one of the many saying
""You've made us proud, you've made us proud, proud""
I'll be one of the many sayin'
""Look at you now, look at you now and now""
I'll be one of the many sayin'
""You've made us proud, you've made us proud, proud""
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh, oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was, ""No""
Now, in this perfect weather, it's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (Forever)


[Chorus]
There you'll stand, ten feet tall (Ten feet tall)
I will say, ""I knew it all along"" (Along)
Your eyes, wider than distance (I knew it all along)
This life is sweeter than fiction (Sweeter than fiction)
There you'll stand, next to me (Next to me)
All at once, the rest is history (Ooh)
Your eyes, wider than distance (I knew it all along)
This life is sweeter than fiction (It's sweeter than fiction)

[Outro]
It's sweeter than fiction
It's sweeter, yeah
It's sweeter, it's sweeter
It's sweeter than fiction"

Stay Stay Stay (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night

I threw my phone across the room at you

I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk
""

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Stay, stay, stay""

I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

But I think that it's best if we both stay


[Verse 2]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me

But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing

And I love you because you have given me


[Chorus]
No choice but to stay, stay, stay

I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay



[Bridge]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes and dreams

I just like hanging out with you

All the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you
For my whole life


[Chorus]
Stay
And I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay

I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay

I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

But I think that it's best if we both stay

Thug Story Lyrics
Taylor teamed up with rapper T-Pain for a PG hip-hop parody of her own song, “Love Story.” It was featured on the 2009 CMT Awards, along with a humorous music video.
[Intro: T-Pain]
Hey, hey
T-Swizzle (T-Swizzle), T-Pizzle (T-Pizzle)


[Verse: Taylor Swift, T-Pain & Both]
I'm like eight foot fo', blonde hair to the floor

You shorties never thought I dreamed about rapping hardcore

No, I ain't got a gun, no, I never really been in a club

Still live with my parents, but I'm still a thug
I'm so gangster, you can find me baking cookies at night

You out clubbing, but I just made caramel delights (Mmm, mmm, good)
T-Swift and T-Pain rapping on the same track
It's a thug story, tell me, can you handle that?

I had a dream last night, I had high top Nikes

I had diamonds in my mouth
, and diamonds on my mic

By the time I woke, I was singing, ""I'm on a boat""
, woah, oh-oh
'Cause I'm a singer-turned rapper
, shorty, I'm a make ya
Straight to the top, yo, shorty, I'm a take ya
You can call me T-Sweezy, now I'm a rap star
Hey, It's a thug story, now tell 'em who you are
Singer-turned gangster, you don't want to fight me

Straight to the top, in my extra small white tee

T-Swift and T-Pain all up on the same track
It's a thug story, now can you get with that?
What? What? I knit sweaters, yo
 (Uh-huh)
What? What? Don't test me (*Beep*)



[Outro: Taylor Swift & T-Pain]
Hey, hold on, hold on, I didn't even say anything
I didn't even s— (What?), I said, ""Yo"" (Yup)
You guys bleeped me and I didn't even say anything (She didn't, she didn't)

[Verse 1]
I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the Moon and back

I remember your blue eyes lookin' into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancin' before bedtime
Then jumpin' on me, waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew

You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you

[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years""

[Verse 2]
I remember the drive home when the blind hope
Turned to cryin' and screamin', ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween, you could be anything
You wanted if you were still here

I remember the last day when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear


[Chorus]
""Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital gray
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years""

[Bridge]
What if I'm standin' in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
And what if the miracle was even gettin' one moment with you?

[Chorus]
Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're gonna fly away from here
You were my best four years

I remember your bare feet down the hallway
I love you to the Moon and back"

Takin' flight, makin' me feel like

I don't even know her

But I feel a responsibility
To do what's upstanding and right
It’s kinda like a code, yeah

And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception

You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up
You chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn’t once been just like her

Don't look at me, you got a girl at home

Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home

Prologue

""These songs were once about my life. They are now about yours.""

I was born in Reading, Pennsylvania on December 13, 1989.

In the world we live in, much is said about when we are born and when we die. Our birthday is celebrated every year to commemorate the very instant we came into the world. And a funeral is held to mark the day we leave it. But lately I've been wondering... what can be said of all the moments in between our birth and our death? The moments when we are reborn...

The debate over whether people change is an interesting one for me to observe because it seems like all I ever do is change. All I ever do is learn from my mistakes so I don't make the same ones again. Then I make new ones. I know people can change because it happens to me little by little every day. Every day I wake up as someone slightly new. Isn't it wild and intriguing and beautiful to think that every day we are new?

For the last few years, I've woken up every day not wanting, but needing to write a new style of music. I needed to change the way I told my stories and the way they sounded. I listened to a lot of music from the decade in which I was born and I listened to my intuition that it was a good thing to follow this gut feeling.
 I was also writing a different storyline than I'd ever told you before.

I wrote about moving to the loudest and brightest city in the world, the city I had always been overwhelmed by... until now. I think you have to know who you are and what you want in order to take on New York and all its blaring truth.
 I wrote about the thrill I got when I finally learned that love, to some extent, is just a game of cat and mouse.
 I wrote about looking back on a lost love and understanding that nothing good comes without loss and hardship and constant struggle. There is no ""riding off into the sunset,"" like I used to imagine.
 We are never out of the woods, because we are always going to be fighting for something.
 I wrote about love that comes back to you just when you thought it was lost forever, and how some feelings never go out of style.
 I wrote about an important lesson I learned recently... that people can say whatever they want about me, but they can't make me lose my mind.
 I've learned how to shake things off.


I've told you my stories for years now. Some have been about coming of age.
 Some have been about coming undone
. This is a story about coming into your own, and as a result... coming alive.

I hope you know that you've given me the courage to change. I hope you know that who you are is who you choose to be, and that whispers behind your back don't define you.
 You are the only person who gets to decide what you will be remembered for.

From the girl who said she would never cut her hair or move to New York
 or find happiness in a world where she is not in love...

Love, Taylor

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burnin' flames or paradise

Fade into view, oh

(Heard from you)

I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'Cause we nеver go out of style, we nеver go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt

And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt

So it goes

He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm

Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat, oh, yeah

That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl



[Pre-Chorus]
He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinkin' 'bout you
,"" and I
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""

'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt

And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)
And when we go crashin' down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go), we never go out of style

Just take me home (Ah)
Yeah, just take me home (Ah)

Red [Liner Notes] Lyrics
Prologue

There's an old poem by Neruda that I've always been captivated by, and one of the lines in it has stuck with me ever since the first time I read it. It says ""love is so short, forgetting is so long.""
 It's a line I've related to in my saddest moments, when I needed to know someone else had felt that exact same way. And when we're trying to move on the moments we always go back to aren't the mundane ones. They are the moments you saw sparks that weren't really there, felt stars aligning without having any proof, saw your future before it happened,
 and then saw it slip away without any warning. These are moments of newfound hope,
 extreme joy,
 intense passion,
 wishful thinking, and in some cases, the unthinkable letdown.
 And in my mind, every one of these memories looks the same to me. I see all of these moments in bright, burning red.

My experiences in love have taught me difficult lessons, especially my experiences with crazy love. The red relationships. The ones that went from zero to a hundred miles per hour and then hit a wall and exploded. And it was awful. And ridiculous. And desperate. And thrilling.
 And when the dust settled, it was something I’d never take back.
 Because there is something to be said for being young and needing someone so badly, you jump in head first without looking.
 And there's something to be learned from waiting all day for a train that's never coming.
 And there's something to be proud of about moving on and realizing that real love shines golden like starlight
, and doesn't fade or spontaneously combust. Maybe I’ll write a whole album about that kind of love if I ever find it. but this album is about the other kinds of love that I’ve recently fallen in and out of.
 Love that was treacherous, sad, beautiful, and tragic.
 But most of all, this record is about love that was red.

A Message From Taylor Lyrics
‘A Message From Taylor’ is a little letter to all her fans that she released along side of the pre-order for the album on Apple Music.
Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heart-broken person
It was all over the place
A fractured mosaic of feelings
 that somehow all fit together in the end
Happy, free, confused, lonely
, devastated, euphoric, wild
And tortured by memories past
These are the original thirty songs that were meant for Red

I love you guys"

My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys (First Draft Phone Memo) Lyrics
[Intro]
Hey, so, um, this is kind of an abnormal structure, but I think it could be really cool this way. And just, it sounds sad 'cause it's on piano, um, and, I'm sad in general. But um, it's gotta have, like, a driving synth beat, or whatever

[Verse 1]
Oh, here we go again
The voices in his head
Ring out louder than our midnight sighs

The sickest army doll

Purchased at the mall
Rivulets descend my plastic smile

[Pre-Chorus]
But you should've seen him when he first got me

[Chorus]
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
Should'vе known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
My boy only breaks his favoritе toys, oh

[Verse 2]
There was a litany of reasons why
It could've been different this time

I know I'm just repeating myself
Put me back on my shelf
But first, pull the string
I'll tell you that he runs
Because he loves me


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me

[Chorus]
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of the kingdoms he destroys, oh, oh

'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
Said forever, then he blew it up, oh, oh

My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys

[Outro]
Just say when, I'd play again
He was my best friend and that was the worst part
I felt more then, in brief moments

Than with all the Kens
'Cause he took me out of my box
Left all these broken parts
And kept my tortured heart

And told me I'm better off
But I'm not

[Outro]
And I think you can just end it like that"

Today Was a Fairytale (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress

You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale

Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress

You wore a dark gray T-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess

Today was a fairytale


[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around


[Chorus]
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?

It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale


[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile

That takes me to another planet

Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say

Is, now it's gettin' so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale



[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?

It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale


[Bridge]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?

It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?

It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 1: Martin Johnson]
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
""Hey, you know, this could be something""
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

[Chorus: Martin Johnson & Taylor Swift]
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

[Verse 2: Martin Johnson & Taylor Swift]
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you

Starlight (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Chorus]
I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight
Like we're made of starlight


[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45

Picks me up late one night, out the window
We were seventeen and crazy, runnin' wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playin' whеn we walked in
The night wе snuck into a yacht club party
Pretendin' to be a duchess and a prince


[Chorus]
And I said, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


[Verse 2]
He said, ""Look at you, worrying too much about things you can't change""
""You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinkin' that way""
He was tryin' to skip rocks on the ocean
, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?""
""Don't you dream impossible things?""


[Chorus]
Like, ""Oh my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how he moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancin', dancin'
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight


[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, he's talkin' crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancin' with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full-on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards

You say my name for the first time, baby
And I fall in love in an empty bar

And you stood there in front of me just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinking of


[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


[Verse 2]
So reach out open handed and lead me out to that floor
I don't need more paper lanterns
Take me down, baby
Bring on the movie score
'Cause my heart is beating fast and you are beautiful
I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would



[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep your beautiful eyes on me
Gonna strike this match tonight

And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow
I'd love to hate it, but you make it like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your eyes open


[Verse 1]
The tricky thing is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score

Keep your eyes open


[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard

Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far

But turn around (Turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown (Showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got something they don't
Yeah, you got something they don't

Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout

Keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
Keep your eyes open

You’re Not Sorry (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
All this time, I was wastin', hopin' you would come around

I've been givin' out chances every time and all you do is let me down

And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinkin' we'll be fine again, but not this time around


[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone

This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry

No, no, no, no

[Verse 2]
You're lookin' so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know

Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't lеft me waitin' in the cold

And you've got your sharе of secrets and I'm tired of bein' last to know, oh

And now you're askin' me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone

This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry

No, no
You're not sorry
No, no

You had me crawlin' for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

So you don't have to call anymore

This is the last straw
There's nothin' left to beg for

And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before

I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are


[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feelin' like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down

And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around

Here's to you and your temper

Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why


[Verse 2]
Well, you could write a book on
How to ruin someone's perfеct day

Well, I get so confused and frustratеd
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh-oh

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around

Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me

Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

Well, I'm sick and tired of your attitude
Feelin' like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me and cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me

You smile that beautiful smile and all the girls in the front row

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation

You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you

Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road

And I can see you years from now in a bar

With that same big, loud opinion, but nobody's listening

Washed up and ranting about the same ole bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean

All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean

The Fate of Ophelia (Track by Track) Lyrics
[Spoken]
""The Fate of Ophelia"" is the first track off of my album The Life of a Showgirl
And I really love this song because it kind of combines sort of Shakespearean storytelling of, you know, this legend of- of this tragic hero Ophelia and what happened to her blended with this kind of newer concept of escaping that fate and having more modern terminology used in the song too
Like, you know, ""Keep it one-hundred on the land, the sea, the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes""

I just love kind of, blending- the blending of old and new with lyrics and that's one of my favorite parts about this song, but it's also just kind of one of my favorite catchy melodies I've ever gotten to write."

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away

This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Verse 1]
Once bitten and twice shy

I keep my distance but you still catch my eye

Tell me baby, do you recognize me
Well, it's been a year, it doesn't surprise me

Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you'd fool me again

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away

This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away

This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special


[Verse 2]
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart

Maybe this year
Maybe this year I'll give it to someone special

'Cause last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away

This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away

This year, to save me from tears
I'll give it to someone special

[Bridge]
And last Christmas
And this year
It won't be anything like, anything like

[Outro]
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away

This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special"

You Are In Love (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
One look, dark room, meant just for you
Time moved too fast, you play it back

Buttons on a coat, lighthearted joke

No proof, not much, but you saw enough

Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight

The light reflects the chain on your neck

He says, ""Look up"" and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in lovе


[Verse 2]
Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday
You keep his shirt, he keeps his word

And for once, you lеt go of your fears and your ghosts

One step, not much, but it said enough
You kiss on sidewalks, you fight, then you talk

One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says, ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love



[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in love


[Bridge]
And so it goes

You two are dancing in a snow globe 'round and 'round

And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words


[Interlude]
'Cause you can hear it in the silence
You can feel it on the way home
You can see it with the lights out
You are in love, true love, you are in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in love (Ah)
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you (Ah)
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you (Ah)
You can see it with the lights out (See it with the lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love, you are in love"

Sparks Fly (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of


[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would

[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile



[Bridge]
I'll run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a fireworks show


[Chorus]
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain

Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile


[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly"

Change (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Well, it's a sad picture, the final blow hits ya
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it’s all the same, another time and place
Repeatin' history and you're gettin’ sick of it

[Pre-Chorus]
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

[Chorus]
Because these things will change, can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raidеd and, now, cornered
It's hard to fight when thе fight ain't fair

We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we’re faster and never scared


[Pre-Chorus]
You can walk away, say, ""We don’t need this""
But there's somethin’ in your eyes, says, ""We can beat this""



[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change, can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come for us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Oh, oh-woah

[Bridge]
Tonight, we’ll stand and get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight


[Chorus]
It was the night things changed, can you see it now?

When the walls that they put up to hold us back fell down

It's a revolution, throw your hands up 'cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah, oh

[Outro]
Hallelujah"

Out Of The Woods (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember

You took a Polaroid of us

Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinkin'

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
And fall back together (Back together)

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget

When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

And I remember thinkin'


[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)


[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room

When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, ""I'm settin' you free""

But the monsters turned out to be just trees

When the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
You were lookin' at me, oh, you were looking at me

(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember



[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?

This is wrong, but I can't help but feel like
There ain't nothin' more right, babe
Misty mornin' comes again and I can't
Help but wish I could see your face
I knew from the first note played
I'd be breakin' all my rules to see you

[Pre-Chorus]
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row
Scream your name


[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
""I can't keep my eyes off of you""

I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl

Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall
Superstar

[Verse 2]
Mornin' lonelinеss comes around when I'm not
Dreamin' about you

Whеn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town

And I knew when I saw your face
I'd be counting down the ways to see you


[Pre-Chorus]
You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row
Scream your name

So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
""I can't take my eyes off of you""

I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl

Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall

You played in bars, you play guitar
I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep
Every night from the radio


[Chorus]
So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
""I can't take my eyes off of you""

I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl

Who's desperately in love with you

Welcome To New York (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow

Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats

Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before

And it said

[Chorus]
""Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you""
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermorе

The lights are so bright, but they nеver blind me, me

Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York


[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors

Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer

Everybody here was someone else before

And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls


[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore

The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York



[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat

The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, new soundtrack
It's been waitin' for you, welcome to New York
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, so bright, they never blind me

I Know Places (Voice Memo) Lyrics
The voice memo for “I Know Places”, the twelfth track on 1989, is one of the three voice memos on the deluxe version of the album, which is exclusively available at Target. Taylor included three different… Read More 
So over the years, a lot of people have asked me to sort of describe my song writing process from beginning to end
How long does it take, where do you write, what are the circumstances, do you start with music, do you start with lyrics, and my answer is always that it happens differently every time, and that's why I'm still so in love with song writing
So what I've done here is shown you three different examples of the beginning stages of these songs and how they each started, different ways
So I'll explain them to you and maybe that will help you understand kind of how I put songs together

I sent this voice memo to Ryan Tedder
 because I'd always wanted to work with him, and finally we scheduled some studio time
So I always wanna be prepared
I wanted to send him the idea that I was working on before we went into the studio just in case he wrote back and said ""I can't stand that, I wanna work on something else, think of something else""
So I just sat down with the piano, put my phone on top of the piano and just kind of explained to him where I wanted to go with the song, how I saw the melody sitting in and we ended up recording the song the next day and it ended up being on the record called ""I Know Places""
So this was the voice memo that I sent to him the night before we ended up finishing the song

""Okay so this is kind of this rough idea thing:

Uh-uh-uh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-i-i-i

Na na na na waiting at the back door
They're around and the vultures come around
And you know that they won't, they won't us
Say what they want 'bout, say what they want 'bout us
And you come and sing and listen
I would not think about it but I'm not done
Every know that a thing or two about it, thing or two about it, I

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes
And guns
They are the hunters we are the foxes
And we run


Baby, I know some places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

Uh-uh-uh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, oh-oh-i, uh-uh-uh-i, know places""


Or whatever
I don't know, but that's basically just like a dark, really dark lyric, like, bridge thing and it's about, like, everybody's, like, trying to get into and ruin a love or whatever, and it's like you just, whatever, you know, and the chorus would just go to that major and just be like ooh chorus
So I hope you like it, it wouldn't be a piano thing
It would be, like, [*vocalizing*]
Like, very, like, beat. Now I'm just making weird sounds
Hope you like it!"

But I don't wanna have to go that far

Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name, oh
Just know, I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain

Screamed your name

I don't know what else I can say

Just know, I'm right here hopin'

1989 (Taylor’s Version) [Prologue] Lyrics
Prologue

When I was 24 I sat in a backstage dressing room in London, buzzing with anticipation. My backup singers and bandmates gathered around me in a scattered circle. Scissors emerged and I watched in the mirror as my locks of long curly hair fell in piles on the floor. There I was in my plaid button down shirt, grinning sheepishly as my tour mates and friends cheered on my haircut. This simple thing that everyone does. But I had a secret. For me, it was more than a change of hairstyle.
 When I was 24, I decided to completly reinvent mysеlf.

How does a person reinvеnt herself, you ask? In any way I could think of. Musically, geographically, aesthetically, behaviorally, motivationally... And I did so joyfully. The curiosity I had felt the first murmurs of while making Red amplified into a pulsing heartbeat of restlessness in my ears. The risks I took when I toyed with pop sounds and sensibilities on Red? I wanted to push it further. The sense of freedom I felt when traveling to big bustling cities? I wanted to live in one. The voices that had begun to shame me in new ways for dating like a normal young woman? I wanted to silence them.

You see—in the years preceding this, I had become the target of slut-shaming—the intensity and relentlessness of which would be criticized and called out if it happened today, the jokes about my amount of boyfriends.
 The trivialization of my songwriting as if it were a predatory act of a boy crazy psychopath, the media co-signing of this narrative. I had to make it stop because it was starting to really hurt.

It became clear to me that for me there was no such thing as casual dating, or even having a male friend who you platonically hang out with. If I was seen with him, it was assumed I was sleeping with him. And so I swore off hanging out with guys, dating, flirting, or anything that could be weaponized against me by a culture that claimed to believe in liberating women but consistently treated me with the harsh moral codes of the Victorian Era.

Being a consummate optimist, I assumed I could fix this if I simply changed my behavior. I swore off dating and decided to focus only on myself, my music, my growth, and my female friendships. If I only hung out with my female friends, people couldn’t sensationalize or sexualize that—right? I would learn later on that people could and people would.


But none of that mattered then because I had a plan and I had a demeanor as trusting as a basket of golden retriever puppies. I had the keys to my own apartment in New York and I had new melodies bursting from my imagination. I had Max Martin and Shellback who were happy to help me explore this new sonic landscape I was enamored with. I had a new friend named Jack Antonoff who had made some cool tracks in his apartment. I had the idea that the album would be called 1989 and we would reference big 80s synths and write sky high choruses. I had sublime, inexplicable faith and I ran right toward it, in high heels and a crop top.

There was so much that I didn't know then, and looking back I see what a good thing that was. This time of my life was marked by right kind of naïveté, a hunger for adventure, and a sense of freedom I hadn't tasted before. It turns out that the cocktail of naïveté, hunger for adventure and freedom can lead to some nasty hangovers, metaphorically speaking. Of course everyone had something to say, but they always will. I learned lessons, paid prices, and tried to... Don't say it... Don't say it... I'm sorry, I have to say it... Shake it off.


I'll always be so incredibly grateful for how you loved and embraced this album. You, who followed my zig zag creative choices and cheered on my risks and experiments. You, who heard the wink and humor in ""Blank Space"" and maybe even empathized with the pain behind the satire. You, who saw the seeds of allyship and advocating for equality in ""Welcome To New York.""
 You, who knew that maybe a girl who surrounds herself with female friends in adulthood is making up for a lack of them in the childhood (Not starting a tyrannical hot girl cult). You, who saw that I reinvent myself for a million reasons, and that one of them is to try my very best to entertain you. You, who have had the grace to allow me the freedom to change.

I was born in 1989, reinvented for the first time in 2014, and a part of me was reclaimed in 2023 with the re-release of this album I love so dearly. Never in my wildest dreams did I imagine the magic you would sprinkle on my life for so long.


This moment is a reflection of the woods we've wandered through and all this love between us still glowing in the darkest dark.


I present to you, with gratitude and wild wonder, my version of 1989.

It's been waiting for you.

I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They’re the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
’Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout

So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through


[Chorus]
Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I’m dyin’ to know, is it killin' you
Like it’s killin' me? Yeah

When it all broke down
And thе story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin’ to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'

When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now

But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight



[Pre-Chorus]
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate

When you see me now, you're not lookin’ at her
Yeah, it's a long way down from the bridges you burned
Might wanna sit down, I'm calling you out
Right now

[Chorus]
You're a heartbreaker and she’s a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen

[Verse 2]
As I was saying, I was never quite a fan of little games
It doesn't take too long to see that boys like you are all the same
Maybe I'm a little less obsessed, but she's impressed
And I should mention, she's starving for attention


[Pre-Chorus]
I can see it now, how it's all gonna be
When she freaks out, you'll be thinkin' of me
'Cause what went down is coming back around
You'll see

[Chorus]
'Cause you're a heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen

[Bridge]
Sometimes you get just what you see
Like, you chose her when you could've had me
Everything's a mess now, watch her little meltdown
Wish you both success and I hope you're happy

[Chorus]
'Cause you're a heartbreaker, she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama
Heartbreaker and she's a little drama queen
I'm a little over it and she's still not me
So long and back to reality
But this song's for you and your drama queen


[Outro]
Huh-oh, for you and your drama queen
Oh-oh-oh-oh, you and your drama queen
Huh-oh, baby, you're a drama queen"

Blank Space (Voice Memo) Lyrics
The voice memo for “Blank Space”, the second track on 1989, is one of the three voice memos on the deluxe version of the album, which is exclusively available at Target. Taylor included three different voice… Read More 
So this next clip is, uh, from a session that I had with Max Martin
 and Johan Shellback
 and what we like to do is we like to run, um, a recording on our phones of everything we're doing when we're putting a song together, just in case one of us blurts out a cool melody and then we forget about it, we wanna go back and then-and replay the tape so that we can remind ourselves what exactly we were saying
Um, so I brought in this idea called ""Blank Space,"" and this was me playing it for Max and Johan for the first time and they're shouting out these proju— production ideas like, you know the ""Oh!"" at the beginning of the chorus, um, and that ended up in the song
So, this is the very beginning stages of the song on the album called ""Blank Space.""

""Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things

Diamonds, seasides, all these gems
[?] this song that [?]
Like, oh my God, listen in
Listen in, I do too
[?]
[?] honest [?]
We can all sing this and cry
All you're thinking, all this time
[?]
Oh my God, listen me
Just forget what you've heard about me
Don't believe what you hear about me, hear about me
'Cause it's gonna be forever, or gonna go—

Yeah! Hey, hey!

Gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over—

This is like a, like an early 2000s Nelly track

Long list of ex-love—
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
I'll write your name
I've got a blank space, baby
I'll write your name""



That's awesome! I love it
Oh my god, everyone's gonna kill you
Yeah!"

Last Kiss (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58

The words that you whispered for just us to know

You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away

I do recall now, the smell of the rain

Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes

All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips


[Verse 2]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showin' off again

And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did

Because I love your handshake meetin' my father

I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets

How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions


[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm


[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep

And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe

And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are

Hope it's nice where you are

[Verse 3]
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day

And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind


[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss


[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips


[Outro]
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last"

But I can't make them stay

At least, that's what people say, mm-mm

And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (Ooh)

I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mm-mm
That's what they don't see, mm-mm

I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)

Hey, hey, hey
Just think, while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been gettin' down to this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, ""Oh, my God"" (Haha), but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We could shake, shake, shake

Haunted (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break

It's getting dark and it's all so quiet

And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold


[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this

I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone

Can't turn back now, I'm haunted


[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing


[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong (Terribly wrong)
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted

Never Grow Up (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight

[Pre-Chorus]
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple

I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

[Post-Chorus]
And never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's droppin' you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots


[Pre-Chorus]
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school

[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
And no one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone

[Verse 3]
So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on


[Chorus]
Wish I'd never grown up
Wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to
Please, try to never grow up

[Outro]
Oh, oh (Never grow up)
Just never grow up

Oh (Never grow up)
Just never grow up"

[Verse 1]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh, oh

Only sound, only sound that you hear is, ""No""
You never saw it comin', slipped when you started runnin'

And now you've come undone, and I, I, I, I


[Pre-Chorus]
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh, ayy
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade

Wish I could make it better, someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever


[Chorus]
There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""

Your eyes, wider than distance

This life is sweeter than fiction

[Verse 2]
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh, oh

All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it comin', you hit the ground runnin'

And now you're on to somethin', I, I, I say

[Pre-Chorus]
""What a sight, what a sight"" when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And, in this perfect weather, it's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


[Chorus]
There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, ""I knew it all along""

Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you'll stand, next to me (Next to me)
All at once, the rest is history (Ooh)
Your eyes, wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction (Sweeter than fiction)

I'll be one of the many sayin'
""Look at you now, look at you now and now""
I'll be one of the many saying
""You've made us proud, you've made us proud, proud""
I'll be one of the many sayin'
""Look at you now, look at you now and now""
I'll be one of the many sayin'
""You've made us proud, you've made us proud, proud""
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

[Pre-Chorus]
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh, oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was, ""No""
Now, in this perfect weather, it's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever (Forever)

There you'll stand, ten feet tall (Ten feet tall)
I will say, ""I knew it all along"" (Along)

Your eyes, wider than distance (I knew it all along)
This life is sweeter than fiction (Sweeter than fiction)
There you'll stand, next to me (Next to me)
All at once, the rest is history (Ooh)
Your eyes, wider than distance (I knew it all along)

You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight

I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign

Somethin' happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circlin', dark clouds

Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide

I know places, I know places

Lights flash and we'll run for the fences

Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time

Not this time

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

New Romantics (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't comin'

We show off our different scarlet letters

Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doin'
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom

Honey, life is just a classroom

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me

And evеry day is like a battle
But evеry night with us is like a dream

Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin
' to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free


[Verse 2]
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding

We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace, ah

We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true

Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah


[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin' (Yeah) to get knocked off our feet (Hey)
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) Oh

(Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) The best people in life are free

Please, take my hand and
Please, take me dancin' and
Please, leave me stranded
It's so romantic (It's so romantic)

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle (Oh, baby, I could build a castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me (At me)
And every day is like a battle (Oh)
But every night with us is like a dream (Is like a dream)
'Cause baby, I could build a castle (Castle)
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle (And every day is like a battle, oh)

Elizabeth Taylor (Track by Track) Lyrics
[Spoken]
Track number two on The Life of a Showgirl is the song ""Elizabeth Taylor""
Elizabeth Taylor is one of the most ultimate, quintessential showgirls I could ever imagine
You know, not in literal sense as much as she was under a microscope so, so intense and she handled it with humor and she got along with her life
She continued to make incredible art and so this is a love song kind of through the lens of the motif of what she had to go through in her life and sort of the parallels that I feel in my own life
You know, role models are pretty hard to come by, but I would absolutely say that she's one of mine."

Father Figure (Track by Track) Lyrics
[Spoken]
""Father Figure"" is a song about power, a song about a protégé and their mentor, and about sort of the idea of the tables turning and the flipping of the script, almost sort of like the son versus the father
And I've always loved stories about that and I've always wanted to create a song that really explained how those roles can shift over time, and I'm really proud of this one, too
It has one of my favorite key changes that I've ever done in a song so, lo-look for that in the end


I would say that lyrically, I had such a blast writing this record because each song is, like, it's own sort of choose your own adventure
Each song feels like an era of it's own, it's just a very dramatic, sweeping, epic record full of twelve songs, but each one really packs a punch and each one is really it's own kind of movie
But the ""Father Figure"" lyrics are my favorite
I remember just writing the lyrics, just like sitting there just being like, ""Heheh, heheheh""
It's the stuff that I've always wanted to say
The first line of the second verse is, like, my favorite in terms of a visual, like, you think about what it means and then you realize it's just like, a very descriptive way to say something

And I love that line, and I also love the key-change chorus lyrics
It's just, it was a blast to write, I, I love like, stepping into a character like that"

[Verse 1]
Wish I had concentrated

They said love was complicated
But it's something I just fell into
And it was overrated
But just look what I've created
I came out alive, but I'm black and blue


[Pre-Chorus]
Before you ask me if I’m alright
Think about what I had to do, yeah

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup

Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan

And I'll bet you thought you'd beat me
Wish you could only see
I got an ""I heart question mark""

Written on the back of my hand


[Verse 2]
I'd be fine if you just walked by
But you had to talk about why
You were wrong and I was right

But I can't believe you made me
Sit at home, cry like a baby
Wait right by the phone every night



[Pre-Chorus]
And now you ask about you and I
There's no you and I
Remember what you put me through, I had to

Wake up and smell the breakup

Fix my heart, put on my makeup
Another mess I didn't plan

And I'll bet you thought you'd beat me

And when you're home all alone at night
You'll still wonder why
You took everything I had, oh, baby

I haven't thought about you and I
There's no you and I
And I know someday you will

[Chorus]
Wake up and smell the breakup

Realize that we won't make up
It didn't go the way you planned
And you'll know you didn't beat me
When you look down and see
I got an ""I heart question mark""
Written on the back of my hand

Written on the back of my hand
An ""I heart question mark,"" yeah

Bad Blood (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems

And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted

Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad lovе
So take a look what you've done
'Causе, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey


[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds, they last and they last

Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you

And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're comin' my way, just don't


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show

If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Ghosts)

Band-aids don't fix bullet holes (Hey)
You say sorry just for show (Hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Hey), mmm
If you love like that, blood runs cold


[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (Mad love)
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey (Bad blood)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (Think we can solve them)
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey ('Cause now we got bad blood)
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey (Ooh, woah, no)
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut

Innocent (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind tryin' to get it back


[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?


[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me
, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

You're still an innocent

[Verse 2]
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again

You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now

If only you had seen what you know now then

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you

Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep

Before the monsters caught up to you?



[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights are still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd

Thirty-two and still growing up now

Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent

[Bridge]
Time turns flames to embers

You'll have new Septembers

Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather

I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new

Oh, oh

[Chorus]
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now

Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent

Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too late to get it back"

Actually Romantic (Track by Track) Lyrics
[Spoken]
""Actually Romantic"" is a song about realizing that someone else has kind of had a one-sided adversarial relationship with you that you didn't know about
And all of a sudden they start, like, doing too much, and they start letting you know that actually you’ve been living in their head rent-free and you had no idea and it's presenting itself as them sort of resenting you or having a problem with you, but, um, taking that and you just accepting it as love and you accepting it as attention and affection and how flattering that somebody has made you such a big part of their reality when you didn't even think about this
It’s actually pretty romantic, if you, if you really, really think about it."

Wonderland (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Flashin' lights
And we took a wrong turn

And we fell down a rabbit hole

You held on tight to me
’Cause nothing's as it seems
And spinning out of control


[Pre-Chorus]
Didn't they tell us, ""Don’t rush into things""?

Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?

Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
I should have slept with one eye open at night


[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but nevеr better, eh, еh

[Post-Chorus]
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland
In Wonderland


[Verse 2]
So, we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
But there were strangers watchin'
And whispers turned to talkin'
And talking turned to screams, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
Didn’t they tell us, ""Don’t rush into things""?
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?

Didn’t you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and excitin'?
I felt your arms twistin' around me
It’s all fun and games 'til somebody loses their mind
But darlin'

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And life was never worse, but never better, eh, eh

[Post-Chorus]
In Wonderland, eh, eh
In Wonderland
In Wonderland, woah
In Wonderland


[Bridge]

I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for somethin' else
To make you feel like what we had

And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad

Oh

[Chorus]
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever (Could last forever)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse, but never better (Never better)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever (In Wonderland)
We found Wonderland, you and I got lost in it (In Wonderland)
And life was never worse, but never better

My TLC was quite OD, ID my facts (ID my)

Now POV of you and me, similar Iraq
I don't hate you, but I hate to critique, overrate you
These beats of a dark heart, use basslines to replace you

Take time and erase you, love don't hear no more, no, I don't fear no more
Better yet, respect ain't quite sincere no more

Remember when you tried to write me off? (Haha)
Remember when you thought I'd take a loss?
Don't you remember? You thought that I would need ya
Follow procedure, remember? Oh, wait, you've got amnesia?

It was my season for battle wounds, battle scars, body bumped, bruised
Stabbed in the back; brimstone, fire jumpin' through

Still, all my life, I got money and power

And you gotta live with the bad blood now (Haha)

folklore [Foreword] Lyrics
It started with imagery. Visuals that popped into my mind and piqued my curiosity.

Stars drawn around scars. A cardigan that still bears the scent of loss twenty years later.
 Battleships sinking into the ocean, down, down, down.
 The tree swing in the woods of my childhood. Hushed tones of ""let's run away"" and never doing it.
 The sun drenched month of August, sipped away like a bottle of wine.
 A mirrored disco ball hovering above a dance floor.
 A whiskey bottle beckoning.
 Hands held through plastic.
 A single thread that, for better or for worse, ties you to your fate
.

Pretty soon these images in my head grew faces or names and became characters. I found myself not only writing my own stories, but also writing about or from the perspective of people I've never met, people I've known, or those I wish I hadn't.
 An exiled man walking the bluffs of a land that isn't his own, wondering how it all went so terribly, terribly wrong
. An embittered tormentor showing up at the funeral of his fallen object of obsession
. A seventeen-year-old standing on a porch, learning to apologize
. Lovestruck kids wandering up and down the evergreen High Line
. My grandfather, Dean, landing at Guadalcanal in 1942
. A misfit widow getting gleeful revenge on the town that cast her out
.

A tale that becomes folklore is one that is passed down and whispered around.
 Sometimes even sung about. The lines between fantasy and reality blur and the boundaries between truth and diction become almost indiscernible.
 Speculation, over time, becomes fact. Myths, ghost stories, and fables. Fairytales and parables. Gossip and legend. Someone's secrets written in the sky for all to behold.


In isolation my imagination has run wild and this album is the result, a collection of songs and stories that flowed like a stream of consciousness. Picking up a pen was my way of escaping into fantasy, history, and memory. I've told these stories to the best of my ability with all the love, wonder, and whimsy they deserve.

Now it's up to you to pass them down

[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air

Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs

If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares

But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine

And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me

Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

And you'll say

[Chorus]
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough

But this love is ours


[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and

Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos

Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours

They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours"

Monologue Song (La La La) Lyrics
This is a song Taylor performed when she hosted the popular show Saturday Night Live
[Verse 1]
I like glitter and sparkly dresses
But I'm not going to talk about that
In my monologue

I like baking and things that smell like winter

But I'm not going to talk about that
In my monologue


[Chorus]
La la la, la la la

[Verse 2]
I like writing songs about douche bags who cheat on me

But I'm not going to say that
In my monologue

I like writing their names into songs so they're ashamed to go in public

But I'm not going to say that
In my monologue


[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

[Verse 3]
You might think I'd bring up Joe
The guy who broke up with me on the phone

But I'm not going to mention him
In my monologue

Hey Joe! I'm doing real well

Tonight I'm hosting SNL
But I'm not going to brag about that
In my monologue



[Chorus]
La la la, ha ha ha
Ha ha ha, ha ha ha
La la la

[Verse 4]
And if you're wondering if I might
Be dating the werewolf from Twilight
[mouths ""Hi Taylor!"", blows him a kiss]

I'm not going to comment on that

In my monologue

[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my musical monologue

[Bridge]
You might be expecting me to say
Something bad about Kanye
And how he ran up on the stage
And ruined my VMA monologue

But there's nothing more to say
'Cause everything's okay
I've got security lining this stage

This is my SNL monologue


[Chorus]
La la, la la la la la
This is my SNL monologue
La la, la la la la la

I Wish You Would (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics

It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start

You say, ""It's in the past,"" you drive straight ahead
You're thinkin' that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said


[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I

Wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you

We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around


[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fightin' for and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore and I

Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

I wish you would, I wish you would

[Verse 3]
2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark

We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide

But it made us turn right back around

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good

Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I

Opalite (Track by Track) Lyrics
[Spoken]
""Opalite"" is a song on my album that I think is just so infectiously, contagiously happy and it's-it's really an expression of happiness
The-The song is itself about choosing happiness and getting through rough times, you know adversity, and really choosing your own joy and your own sort of path to joy and it didn't just happen accidentally for you
Opalite is actually a man-made opal, so I kinda took that metaphor of a man-made gemstone and applied it to, well, you know, what if you make your own happiness in life, I really loved that sort of comparison between the two and that analogy and it turned into one of my favorite songs on the album."

So, we're gonna have the band take a little tiny break and I'm gonna play you a song that, uh, I wrote this when I was like thirteen years old and just moved to Nashville, and I knew that I wanted to end up making music and on a record label, but I didn't know how I was going to get there. And I wrote this song about it

[Verse 1]
I don't know what I want, so don't ask me
Cause I'm still trying to figure it out
Don't know what's down this road, I'm just walking
Trying to see through the rain coming down
Even though I'm not the only one
Who feels the way I do

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world

[Verse 2]
Got the radio on, my old blue jeans
And I'm wearing my heart on my sleeve
I'm feeling lucky today, got the sunshine
Could you tell me what more do I need
And tomorrow's just a mystery, oh yeah
But that's OK

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know
I'll be strong, I'll be wrong, oh but life goes on
Oh, I'm just a girl, trying to find a place in this world


[Guitar Solo]

[Chorus]
I'm alone, on my own, and that's all I know

(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road


[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay

Had me in the palm of your hand, then

Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)

All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was stay


[Verse 2]
Here you are now, callin' me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been pickin' up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye


[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then

Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)

You were all I wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
But not like this

Not like this, not like this
Oh, all you had to do was


[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then

Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy
All you had to do was
(Stay; Ah) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then

Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?

Macavity Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Macavity's a mystery cat, he's called the Hiddenpaw
For he's the master criminal who can defy the law
He's the bafflement of Scotland Yard, the Flying Squad's despair
For when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's broken every human law
, he breaks the law of gravity
His powers of levitation would make a fakir stare
But when they reach the scene of crime, Macavity's not there

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Macavity's a ginger cat
, he's very tall and thin
You would know him if you saw him for his eyes are sunken in
His brow is deeply lined with thought, his head is highly domed
His coat is dusty from neglect, his whiskers are uncombed
He sways his head from side to side, with movements like a snake
And when you think he's half asleep, he's always wide awake

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
For he's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity's not there


[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
He's outwardly respectable, I know, he cheats at cards
And his footprints are not found in any files of Scotland Yard's
And when the larder's looted and the jewel case is rifled
Or when the milk is missing or another peke's been stifled
Or the greenhouse glass is broken and the trellis past repair
There's the wonder of the thing, Macavity's not there

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Idris Elba & Both]
Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
There never was a cat of such deceitfulness and suavity
He always has an alibi, and one or two to spare
What ever time the deed took place, Macavity wasn't there
And they say that all the cats whose wicked deeds are widely known
I might mention Mungojerrie, Rumpleteazer, Griddlebone
Are nothing more than agents for the cat who all the time
Just controls the operations, the Napoleon of Crime

Macavity, Macavity, there's no one like Macavity
He's a fiend in feline shape, a monster of depravity
You may meet him in a by-street, you may see him in the square
But when a crime's discovered, then Macavity, Macavity
Macavity, Macavity

[Outro: Idris Elba, Taylor Swift]
When a crime's discovered, then
Macavity's not there"

Superman (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Tall, dark, and superman

He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say
And you smile and say, ""How are you?”
And I'll say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you, ""I love you""
I love you forever

[Chorus]
I watch Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down


[Verse 2]
Tall, dark and beautiful
He's complicated, he's irrational
But I hope someday you'll take me away, and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'

He's not all bad like his reputation

And I can't hear one single word they say
And you'll leave, got places to be, and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you, ""I love you""
I loved you from the very first day



[Chorus]
I watch Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch Superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

[Bridge]
And I watch you fly around the world
And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me

I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window
Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

[Breakdown]
Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you
'Cause I loved you from the very first day

[Chorus]
I watch Superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever
And I watch Superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down

La, la, la, la, la, la

Red Lyrics
[Verse 1: Ally & Normani]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus: All & Lauren]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red, red, red
But loving him was red, red, red
But loving him was red, red, red, red, red, red

[Verse 2: Camila & Dinah]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong


[Chorus: All & Lauren]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red, red, red
But loving him was red, red, red
Oohhh burning red, red, red, red, red, red

[Bridge: Camila & [Normani] & (Lauren) & Dinah & {Ally} & All]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks {flashbacks} [and echoes]
(Tell myself it's time now) time now, gotta let go
{But moving on from} him is impossible
When I still see it all in {my head}

[Chorus: Lauren & All & (Ally)]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody (you never met)
But loving him was red, red, red (was red)
But loving him was red, red, red (was red)
But loving him was red, red, red, red, red, red (red red)

[Outro: Ally & All]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati

Wood (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Daisy's bare naked, I was distraught
He loves me not
He loves me not
Penny’s unlucky, I took him back
And then stepped on a crack
And the black cat laughed

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby, I'll admit I've been a little superstitious (Superstitious)
Fingers crossed until you put your hand on mine (Ah)
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
A bad sign is all good, I ain’t gotta knock on wood

[Chorus]
(Ah) All of that missin', wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain't got to knock on wood

[Post-Chorus]
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He (Ah!) hypnotised me and opened my eyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was the key that opened my skies


[Verse 2]
Girls, I don't need to catch the bouquet, mm
To know a hard rock is on the way

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby, I’ll admit I’ve been a little superstitious (Superstitious)
The curse on me was broken by your magic wand (Ah)
Seems to be that you and me, we make our own luck
New Heights (New Heights) of manhood (Manhood), I ain't gotta knock on wood

[Chorus]
(Ah) All of that missin’, wishing on a falling star
Never did me any good, I ain't got to knock on wood
(Ah) It's you and me forever dancing in the dark
All over me, it's understood, I ain’t got to knock on wood

[Post-Chorus]
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He (Ah) hypnotised me and opened my eyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was the key that opened my skies
Forgive me, it sounds cocky
He (Ah) hypnotised me and opened my eyes
Redwood tree, it ain't hard to see
His love was the key that opened my skies"

[Verse 1: Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Waw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy, ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the good girls bad for a weekend

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe, Eric Vanlerberghe]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Verse 2: Eric Vanlerberghe & Brian Burkheiser]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the queen, baby, I'm your king
Find out what you want
Be that guy for a month
But the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I could make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like, ""Oh my God
Who is he? Who is he?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe, Eric Vanlerberghe]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Bridge]
Girls only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, don't say I didn't warn you

[Breakdown]
It's torture, it's torture
Don't say I didn't warn you
It's torture, it's torture
Don't say I didn't warn you

[Chorus: Brian Burkheiser, Brian Burkheiser & Eric Vanlerberghe, Eric Vanlerberghe]
So it's gonna be forever

If This Was a Movie (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Last night, I heard my own heart beatin'
Sounded like footsteps on my stairs
Six months gone and I'm still reachin'
Even though I know you're not there
I was playin' back a thousand memories, baby
Thinkin' 'bout everything we've been through
Maybe I've been going back too much lately
When time stood still and I had you


[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now


[Verse 2]
I know people change and these things happen

But I remember how it was back then
Wrapped up in your arms and our friends are laughin'
'Cause nothing like this ever happened to them
Now I'm pacing down the hall, chasing down your street
Flashback to the night when you said to me
Nothing's gonna change, not for me and you
Back before I knew how much I had to lose



[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now


[Bridge]
If you're out there, if you're somewhere, if you're moving on
I've been waiting for you every day since you've been gone
I just want it back the way it was before
And I just wanna see you back at my front door


[Breakdown]
And I say, ""Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would before you said it's not that easy
Before the fight, before I locked you out""
But I take it all back now

[Chorus]
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You would, you would if this was a movie
Stand in the rain outside 'til I came out
Come back, come back, come back to me like
You could, you could if you just said you're sorry
I know that we could work it out somehow
But if this was a movie, you'd be here by now



[Outro]
You'd be here by now
It's not the kind of ending you wanna see now
Baby, what about the ending?

Oh, I thought that you'd be here by now
Oh, oh
Thought you'd be here by now"

Sweet Tea and God’s Graces Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Tire swings, summer dreams, honeysuckle on the breeze
Wilson County creek

Laying in the green grass, I was watching clouds pass

Baby, you were watching me
Cold barns, truck beds, everything you said
Slowly educating me
I never had a lesson so sweet


[Chorus]
You can get high on a first kiss

You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces

You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof

You can crash and burn and come back someone new

And that's what I learned from you

[Verse 2]
Autumn rain, window pane, looking how the leaves change
Just like the two of us

Still got your laugh, your ghost, your jacket
Guess I loved you way too much

But I'm a little smarter, my heart's a little harder

But it's still soft enough to cry
Cause I remember those times
I remember


[Chorus]
You can get high on a first kiss

You can get by with sweet tea and God's graces

You can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof

You can crash and burn and come back someone new

And that's what I learned from you

[Bridge]
Saw you just the other day
All that I could think to say was
""Hey, how have you been?""

You caught me with that old smile

Said, ""It's really been a while
And I still think about back when""

[Chorus]
We used to get high on the first kiss
We could get by with sweet tea and Jesus

And you can love like a sinner and lose like a winner
Nothing's shatterproof

You can crash and burn and now I'm someone new

And that's what I learned from you

[Outro]
Oh, that's what I learned from you
That's what I learned from you, oh you, oh
That's what I learned from you, oh yeah"

What about his size!!
Tonight I'm gonna catch him!
I'll set a real big trap!
Then I'll train him really well.
He'll answer when I clap!

When I looked up in that closet, there was nothing there but stuff.
I know that monster's in there!
I heard him huff and puff!
Could it be he wants to eat me?
Maybe I'm his favorite tray.
And if he comes to get me,
I'll scream loudly, ""Go away!!""
If he's nice, I'll name him ""Happy.""
If he's bad I'll name him ""Grouch.""

Taylor: I'm, like, this close to overexposure.

Kanye: Oh well this one is, uh — I think this is a really cool thing to have.
Taylor: I know! I mean it's like a compliment kind of.
Kanye: What I give a fuck about is just you as a person, and as a friend.

Taylor: That's sweet.
Kanye: I want things that make you feel good. I don't wanna do rap that makes people feel bad.
Taylor: Um, yea. I mean, go with whatever line you think is better. It's obviously very tongue in cheek either way.
Taylor: And I really appreciate you telling me about it, that's really nice!
Kanye: Yea. I just felt I had a responsibility to you as a friend. I mean, thanks for being so cool about it.
Taylor: Aw, thanks! Yeah I really appreciate it. Like, the heads up is so nice!
Taylor: …things without like even asking or seeing if I'd be OK with it. And I just really appreciate it.
Taylor: I'd never expect you to tell me about a line in your song.
Taylor: And then the flowers that you sent me, I Instagrammed a picture of them and it's the most Instagram likes I've ever gotten.

Kanye: Relationships are more important than punchlines, you know.

Taylor: Yea. I mean, I don't think anybody would listen to that and be like, Oh, that's a real diss. Like, she must be crying about…
Taylor: You gotta tell the story the way that it happened to you and the way you experienced it. Like you honestly didn't know who I was before that.
Taylor: It doesn't matter if I sold 7 million of that album before you did that, which is what happened. You didn't know who I was before that.
Taylor: … that I can make these things happen and I have the ideas to do it and I create these things and concepts. And, like, I'm always gonna respect you.
Taylor: And I'm really glad you had the respect to call me and tell me that as a friend, about the song. It's just a really cool thing to do, and a really good show of friendship. So thank you.
Kanye: Thank you too.
Taylor: And you know, if people ask me about it, I think it would be great for me to be like, Look, he called me and told me about the line before it came out. Like, joke's on you guys, we're fine.
Taylor: You guys wanna call this a feud, you wanna call this throwing shade. But right after the song comes out I'm gonna be on a Grammy red carpet and they're gonna ask me about it and I'm gonna be like, he called me.
Taylor: …awesome that you're so outspoken and it's gonna be like, Yea, she does, it made her famous! It's more provocative to say, Might still have sex.
Taylor: …it's not. It doesn't matter to me. There's not one that hurts my feelings and one that doesn't.

2020 Leak

Kanye: —old school s—, yeah. I’m doing great. I feel so awesome about the music. The album’s coming out Feb. 11. I’m doing the fashion show Feb. 11 at Madison Square Garden and dropping the album Feb. 12, that morning. It’s like …. yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Aw thank you so, so much. Thank you. It feels like, real. I don’t know, just ‘Ye, Apple, Steve Jobs-type music. Like, so my next single, I wanted you to tweet it … so that’s why I’m calling you. I wanted you to put the song out.
Taylor: What would people … I guess it would just be, people would be like, “Why is this happening?” And I had something to do with it, probably.

Kanye: The reason why it would happen is because it has a very controversial line at the beginning of the song about you.

Taylor: What does it say? [nervous laughter]

Kanye: It says, and the song is so, so dope, and I literally sat with my wife, with my whole manager team, with everything, and try to rework this line. I’ve thought about this line for eight months, I’ve had this line and tried to rework it every which way, and the original way that I thought about it is the best way, but it’s the most controversial, so it’s gonna go Eminem a little bit, so can you brace yourself for a second?

Taylor: Yeah…

Kanye: Okay, alright. It says—wait a second, you sound sad.

Taylor: Well, is it gonna be mean?

Kanye: No, I don’t think it’s mean.

Taylor: Okay, then let me hear it.

Kanye: Okay, um … and the funny thing is when I first played it and my wife heard it, she was like “Huh? What? That’s too crazy, blah, blah, blah.” And when Ninja from Die Antwoord heard it, he was like, “Oh God, this is the craziest sh—! This is why I love Kanye,” that kind of thing. It’s like my wife’s favorite f—ing line. I just wanted to give you some premise of that, right?

Taylor: Okay.

Kanye: So it says, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like Taylor Swift might owe me sex.” [chuckles]


Taylor: [chuckles] That’s not mean.
Kanye: Okay. Yeah, well, this is the thing why I’m calling you because you got an army. You own a country of motherfucking two billion people, basically, that if you felt that it’s funny and cool and like hip hop and felt like, you know, just The College Dropout and the artist like, ‘Ye that you love, then I think that people would be like way into it, and that’s why I think it’s super genius to have you be the one that says, ‘Oh, I like this song a lot, like, yeah, whatever. This is cool. Whatever, it’s like, I got like s— on my album where I’m like, “I bet me and Ray J will be friends if we ain’t love the same bitch.”

Taylor: Oh my [laughs]. I mean, I need to think about it because you hear something for the first time, you need to think about it because it is absolutely crazy. I’m glad it’s not mean though. It doesn’t feel mean, but like, oh my God, the build-up you gave it. I thought it was gonna be like that stupid dumb bitch, like, but it’s not.
 Um, so I don’t know. I mean, the launch thing, I think it would be kind of confusing to people, but I definitely like, I definitely think that when I’m asked about, of course I’m gonna be like, “Yeah, I’m his biggest fan. I love that. I think it’s hilarious,” but um, I’ll think about it.

Kanye: Yeah, you don’t have to do—you don’t have to do the launch and retweet. That’s just an extra idea that I had, like, but if you think that that’s cool, then that’s cool. If not, we are launching the shit like on just GOOD Fridays, on Soundcloud, the site, shit like that.

Taylor: You know, the thing about me is like, anything that I do becomes a feminist think-piece, and if I launch it, they’re gonna be like, “Wow,” like this thing—like they’ll just turn it into something that … I think if I launch it, it honestly like, it’ll be less cool ‘cause I think if I launch it, it adds this level of criticism, ‘cause having that many followers and having that many eyeballs on me right now, people are just looking for me to do something dumb or stupid or lame, and it’s like almost … I don't know, like I kind of feel like people would try to make it negative if it came from me. Do you know what I mean?

Kanye: Yeah.

Taylor: I try to be super self-aware about where I am, and I feel like, I feel like right now I’m like this close to overexposure.


Kanye: Oh, well, this one is uh, I think this is a really cool thing to have.

Taylor: I know, it’s like a compliment, kind of [laughs].

Kanye: I had this line where I said—and my wife really didn’t like this one because we tried to make it nicer. So I said, “To all my Southside n— that know me best/ I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex,” and my wife was really not with that one. She was way more into “She owes you sex,” but then the owe, the owe part was like the feminist group-type s— that I was like, “Ahhh.”


Taylor: That’s the part that I’m kind of—I mean, they’re both really edgy, but that’s the only thing about that line is that it’s like gonna … It's just, the feminists are gonna come out, but I mean, you don’t give a fuck, so…

Kanye: Yeah, basically. Well, what I give a fuck about is just you as a person and as a friend. I want things that make—


Taylor: That’s sweet.

Kanye: —you feel good. I don’t wanna do rap that makes people feel bad, like of course like I’m mad at Nike, so people think like, “Oh, he’s a bully. He ran on stage with Taylor. He’s bullying Nike now, this $50 billion company.”
Taylor: Why are people saying you’re bullying Nike?

Kanye: Because on “Facts” I said like, “Yeezy, Nike out here bad, they can’t give shit away.”

Taylor: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, that’s just what you do though.

Kanye: [laughs]

Taylor: [laughs] I mean, I wouldn’t say that it’s like possible to bully a company like Nike where—I mean, um, yeah, I mean …"

Eldest Daughter (Track by Track) Lyrics
[Spoken]
Track five on my album is called 'Eldest Daughter,' and this is—it's a love song about kind of the roles that we play in our public life, because nowadays everyone has a public life. You have a life that you portray to other people or what you portray on social media, and then you have the you that everyone gets to know who has earned the right to be closest to you. And it's really hard to be sincere publicly because that's not really what our culture rewards. People reward you for being like tough and unbothered and like too busy to care. And you may be that about some things, but everyone has things that matter to them and people that matter to them. This song really kind of gets to the heart of when someone gets close enough to you to earn your trust, that's when you can admit to them that you actually really do care about some things."

[Spoken]
The song ""Wood"" is about, it's a love story about, you know, kind of using as a plot device superstitions, popular superstitions, good luck charms, bad luck charms, all these different ways that we have decided things are good luck or bad luck, like knocking on wood and seeing a black cat. And that is kind of the way that I've decided to explore this very, very sentimental love song."

[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Stand there like a ghost, shakin' from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane-ane?""
Say, ""It's been a long six months""
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want


[Pre-Chorus]
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then you say

[Chorus]
""I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together

I would wait forever and ever""
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl


[Verse 2]
Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah, yеah
Of pictures in frames, of kisses on cheeks, cheeks

Tеll her how you must have lost your mind, ooh
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why


[Pre-Chorus]
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now you say

[Chorus]
""I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together (Put it back together)
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)""
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
And you know
That I don't want you to go

[Break]
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks

And say you want me, yeah, yeah, 'cause
And then you say

""I want you for worse or for better (Worse or for better)
I would wait forever and ever (Ever and ever)
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I want you forever and ever (I want you forever and ever)""

That's how you get the girl, girl (Get the girl, that's how it works)
And that's how it works (Oh)

Fearless [Liner Notes] Lyrics
The Fearless Platinum Edition was the only deluxe album of Taylor’s to receive its own different liner notes that included the bonus tracks.
Prologue

This album is called ""Fearless"", and I guess I'd like to clarify why we chose that as the title. To me, ""Fearless"" is not the absence of fear. It's not being completely unafraid. To me, fearless is having fears. Fearless is having doubts. Lots of them. To me, fearless is living in spite of those things that scare you to death. Fearless is falling madly in love again, even though you've been hurt before. Fearless is walking into your freshman year of high school at fifteen.
 Fearless is getting back up and fighting for what you want over and over again...even though every time you've tried before, you've lost. It's fearless to have faith that someday things will change.
 Fearless is having the courage to say goodbye to someone who only hurts you, even if you can't breathe without them.
 I think it's fearless to fall for your best friend, even though he's in love with someone else.
 And when someone apologizes to you enough times for things they'll never stop doing, I think it's fearless to stop believing them. It's fearless to say ""you're NOT sorry"", and walk away.
 I think loving someone despite what people think is fearless.
 I think allowing yourself to cry on the bathroom floor is fearless.
 Letting go is fearless.
 Then, moving on and being alright...That's fearless, too. But no matter what love throws at you, you have to believe in it. You have to believe in love stories and prince charmings and happily every after.
 That's why I write these songs. Because I think love is fearless

Ruin The Friendship (Track by Track) Lyrics
[Spoken]
'Ruin the Friendship' is a song that kind of wistfully goes back in time to moments that you hesitated, moments that you were too scared or anxious to do something that you were really curious about, you know, the idea of if you told this person you had feelings for them or if you kissed this person, you might ruin the friendship. And it kind of goes back in time and, and explores what really would have been so bad about that. So it's really kind of a beautiful story of taking chances when they present themselves and not letting them pass you by, not having to spend your lifе wondering what would have happenеd if you would have done it."

[Verse 1]
She walks to school
With her arms crossed
It's just another day
At 10 o clock she hears this screaming
Then finally she sees them
It's scary how things change
And I saw the story on the news
I saw the footage from the roof
I sat down and cried


[Chorus]
Didn't she call you
Didn't she need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of

Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't she pray too

[Verse 2]
He kissed his wife goodbye
And took the earliest flight
So he could be home that night
To put his kids to sleep
Down the aisle
Three men walked and said
We're here to die for our God
He stood up and said that's funny
'Cause my God died for me

I put the magazine down
I read his words out loud
I sat down and cried


[Chorus]
And didn't he call you
Didn't he need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
And didn't he pray to oh

[Verse 3]
The taxis pulled up
On the very day of
They rode 100 floors up
Just to come back down
They never thought they'd see the day
That the tower's up in flames
There was nothing left to say
When it all came down


[Chorus]
And didn't they call you
Didn't they need you bad enough
Was there some reason
I'm not aware of
Did you not write it down
Just one more thing to do
Where were you
Where were you
And didn't they pray to
Oh

I walk to school
And I wear a cross
I'm counting

State Of Grace (Acoustic Version) (Taylor’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights

Busy streets and busy lives

And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds

We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time


[Chorus]
And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same


[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball

Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes


[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong

Wе learn to live with the pain, mosaic brokеn hearts

But this love is brave and wild


[Chorus]
I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same


[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight

Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate

You're my Achilles heel

This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

[Chorus]
And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same
Oh, I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same

This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight

And it feels like everybody has different priorities. And it's kind of about exploring all those different lives that people want and all those different aspirations that people have, but knowing that you havе your own set of wishes. and it doesn't havе to be like everybody else's and theirs doesn’t have to be like yours and everybody, you just hope everybody gets their wishes but these are yours."

[Spoken]
The song 'CANCELLED!' is sort of about, you know, having had my own experiences with mass judgment and being at the center of many, you know, dramatic kind of scandalous moments in my career where people were all weighing in at once, or at least it felt like that. Having had those experiences, it makes me move through the world a little bit differently. And when other people go through it, you kind of find yourself thinking about how they're probably going to get smarter because of this. If they can get through it, if they can be tough enough, they can actually learn some things through this process. And how I don't naturally just cast people aside just because other people decide they don't like them. I make my own decisions about people based on how they treat me within my life and their actions. And so this is a song about all those themes. Here's 'CANCELLED!'"

[Verse 1]
What if ribbons and bows didn't mean a thing?
Would the song still survive without five golden rings?

Would you still wanna kiss without mistletoe?
What would happen if God never let it snow?
What would happen if Christmas carols told a lie?
Tell me, what would you find?

[Chorus]
You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial

So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore

And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

[Verse 2]
What if angels did not pay attention to
All the things that we wished they would always do?
What if happiness came in a cardboard box?

Then I think there is something we all forgot
What would happen if presents all went away?
Tell me, what would you find?

You'd see that today holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to the birthday boy who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
So here's something you should know that is for sure
Christmas must be something more

We get so caught up in all of it
Business and relationships
Hundred-mile-an-hour lives
And it's this time of year
And everybody's here
It seems the last thing on your mind

Is that the day holds something special
Something holy, not superficial
So here's to Jesus Christ who saved our lives
It's something we all try to ignore
And put a wreath up on your door
But here's something you should know that is for sure

Christmas must be something
Christmas must be something more

Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) [Prologue] Lyrics
Prologue

When I think back on the Speak Now album, I get a lump in my throat. I have a feeling it will always be that way, because this period of time was so vibrantly aglow with the last light of the setting sun of my childhood. I made this album, completely self-written, between the ages of 18 and 20. I've spoken about how I feel like those ages are the most emotionally turbulent ones in a person's life. Maybe when I say that, I'm really just talking about myself.

I think they might just be the most idealistic, hopеful years too. At this point in my life, I had relеased my second album, Fearless, it became the breakthrough moment I'd always dreamt of, one that catapulted my career to new realms of success. It had brought with it tidal wave of premises and pitfalls and growing pains. All the while, I was encountering the milestones and checkpoints of normal teenage growth. I had cataclysmic crushes and brushes with heartache, I moved out of my parents' house and set my bags down in a new apartment, I hung photos on my walls and decorated the space where I would sob and cackle and chatter and dream. Sometimes I feel like a grown up, but a lot of the time I just wanted to time travel back to my childhood bed, where my mom would read stories to me until I fell asleep.


In my darker moments, I was tormented by the doubt that swirled loudly around my ascent and my merits as an artist. I was trying to create a follow up to the most awarded country album in history, while staring directly into the face of intense criticism. I had been widely and publicly slammed for my singing voice and was first encountering the infuriating question that is unfortunately still lobbed at me to this day: does she really write her songs?
Spoiler alert: I really, really do.


In the years since, I've developed a thicker skin about public criticism and the cynicism with which some people approach the music I make. At that time, it leveled me. I had these voices in my head telling me that I had the perfect chance and I blew it. I hadn't been good enough, I had given it all and been found wanting.

I wanted to get better, to challenge myself, and to build on my skills as a writer, an artist, and a performer. I didn't want to just be handed respect and acceptance in my field, I wanted to earn it. To try and confront these demons, I underwent extensive vocal training and made a decision that would completely define the album: I decided I would write it entirely on my own. I figured, they couldn't give all the credit to my cowriters if there weren't any.
 But that posed a new challenge: It really had to be good. If it wasn't, it would be proving my critics right.

I had no idea how much this pain would change me. That this was the beginning of my series of creative choices made by reacting to setbacks with defiance. That my stubbornness in the face of doubters and dissenters would become my coping mechanism through my entire career from that point forward. This exact pattern of enacting my own form of rebellion when I feel broken is exactly why you're reading these very words, and I'm re-releasing this album now.

I went through my first worldwide scandal (the mic-grab seen around the world)
. I experienced the weirdness of trying to get to know a boy while a swarm of paparazzi surrounds the car. Media contacting my publicist for an official statement on why two teenagers broke up. These are weird experiences to have at any age, but even more surreal when you're 19.

I had the nagging sense that in the most intense moments of my life, I had frozen. I had said nothing publicly, I still don't know if it was an instinct, not wanting to seem impolite, or just ofmverwhelming fear. But I made sure to say it all in these songs. I decided to call the album Speak Now. It was a play on the ""speak now or forever hold your peace"" moment in weddings, but for me it symbolized a chance to respond to the chatter and commentary around my own life.

Some of these emotional revelations were surprising to people. Some expected anger and instead got compassion and empathy with ""Innocent.""
 Some expected a kiss of breakup song but instead got a hand-on-heart apology, ""Back to December."" It was an album that was the most precious to me because of its vast extremes. It was unfiltered and potent. In my mind, the saddest song I've ever written is ""Last Kiss."" My most scathing is ""Dear John"" and my most wistfully romantic is ""Enchanted.""

I'll be forever proud of setting a goal and seeing it through. I'll always feel shivers all over when I remember singing ""Long Live"" to close the show every night on tour. The outstretched hands of those bright and beautiful faces of the fans. Their support was like an open palm that reached out and helped me up off the ground when others were, frankly, mean.

These days I make my choices for those people who thought I had been good enough all along. I try to speak my mind when I feel strongly in the moment I feel it. I'm still idealistic and earnest about the music I make, but I'm less crushed when people mock me for it. I know now that one of the bravest things a person can do is create something with unblinking sincerity, to put it all on the line. I still sometimes wish I was a little kid again in a tiny bed before I ever grew up.


I always looked at this album as my album, and the lump in my throat expands to a quivering voice as I say this. Thanks to you, dear reader
, it finally will be.

I consider this music to be, along with your faith in me, the best thing that's ever been mine.

Yours,

Taylor"

Father Figure (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
""You remind me of a younger me,"" I saw potential

[Chorus]
I'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my check’s bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve

[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family

[Verse 2]
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, ""They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign""
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé

[Chorus]
I'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my check’s bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets


[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family

[Bridge]
I saw a change in you (I saw a change, saw a change in you)
My dear boy
They don't make loyalty like they used to (Not like they used to)
Your thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition
On foolish decisions, which led to misguided visions
That to fulfill your dreams
You had to get rid of me
I protect the family

[Chorus]
I was your father figure, we drank that brown liquor
You made a deal with this devil, turns out my check’s bigger
You want a fight? You found it, I got the place surrounded
You'll be sleeping with the fishes before you know you're drowning
Whose portrait's on the mantel? Who covered up your scandals?
Mistake my kindness for weakness and find your card cancelled
I was your father figure, you pulled the wrong trigger
This empire belongs to me

[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me


[Outro]
""You know, you remind me of a younger me""
I saw potential"

[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more

And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me

Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town

And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame



[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do

And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath

Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
And maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
Maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest

I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all


[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell

Every time you double-cross my mind

You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you

That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show

But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?

Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well


[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Just between us, I remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it"

Long Live (Live/2011) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I said, remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age


[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, remember this feeling
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world


[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

[Spoken Interlude]
We have absolutely loved spending time in your town, and you have been so amazing to us
I mean, you guys know every single word and you’ve danced this entire night and it means the world to me and every single person you see on stage
Thank you

[Breakdown]
Will you take a moment?
And Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please tell ‘em my name
Tell them how the crowds went wild
Tell them how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life, with you


[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
I'm not afraid
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
Long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"

[Spoken Intro]
Now, uh, we're gonna play a song by Taylor Swift here
I really love the melodies in this song
I think that they're just absolutely brilliant
It's really good melody writing
What? I'm serious
I love the melodies in this song, it's good

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Eh, eh
New money, suit and tie
I could read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny rumors lie?
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
Dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make a bad guy good for a weekend


[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me, when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Woah)
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storm
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darlin', I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream


[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me, when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Woah)
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby

[Verse 3]
When the night has come and the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No, I won't be afraid, no, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me

[Bridge]
So darlin', darlin' stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand
Stand by me, stand by me


[Chorus]
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

This is another way I've written songs recently
This is a song I did with Jack Antonoff
, and Jack is one of my friends and so we were hanging out and he pulled out his phone and goes ""I made this amazing track the other day. It's so cool, I love these guitar sounds.""
And he played it for me and immediately I could hear this finished song in my head, and I just said ""Please, please let me have that. Let me play with it, like send it to me""
And so he sent it to me and I was on tour and this was me playing the track on my laptop recording me singing the vocal into my phone and it ended up being a song called ""I Wish You Would"", because Jack wrote back and said ""I love that""
So this is another way of writing, it's writing to track:

Okay so this is an idea called ""I Wish You Would"". It's kind of about this guy who's like, he's driving down the street at the middle of the night and he passes his ex-girlfriend's house and it's like, he thinks she hates him, but she's still in love with him, very dramatic. This track is sick, hope you like this

It's 2 am, in your car
Windows down, past my street the memories start
It's in the past
You drive straight ahead
You thinking that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did
I wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live, and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 1]
I don't think that passenger seat
Has ever looked this good to me

He tells me about his night
And I count the colors in his eyes

He'll never fall in love, he swears

As he runs his fingers through his hair

I’m laughing 'cause I hope he's wrong
And I don't think it ever crossed his mind
He tells a joke, I fake a smile

But I know all his favorite songs


[Chorus]
And I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes

And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie

[Verse 2]
He looks around the room
Innocently overlooks the truth

Shouldn't a light go on?

Doesn't he know that I've had him memorized for so long?
He sees everything in black and white

Never let nobody see him cry
I don't let nobody see me wishin' he was mine


[Chorus]
I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, born on the seventeenth
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
I'd lie


[Bridge]
He stands there, then walks away
My God, if I could only say
I'm holding every breath for you

He'd never tell you, but he can play guitar
I think he can see through everything but my heart

First thought when I wake up
Is, ""My God, he’s beautiful""
So I put on my makeup
And pray for a miracle


[Chorus]
Yes, I could tell you his favorite color's green
He loves to argue, oh, and it kills me
His sister's beautiful, he has his father's eyes
And if you asked me if I love him
If you asked me if I love him
I’d lie"

Album of the Year Acceptance Speech (Grammys 2016) Lyrics
I want to thank the fans for the last 10 years, and the recording academy for giving us this unbelievable honor. I want to thank all of the collaborators that you see on this stage. Mostly, I want to thank my co-executive producer Max Martin, who has deserved to be up here for 25 years.
 And as the first woman to win album of the year at the Grammy's twice, I want to say to all the young women out there, there are going to be people along the way who will try to undercut your success or take credit for your accomplishments or your fame.
 But if you just focus on the work and you don't let those people sidetrack you, someday when you get where you're going, you will know it was you and the people who love you who put you there, and that will be the greatest feeling in the world. Thank you for this moment."

Forever & Always (Piano Version) [Taylor’s Version] Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time

I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto somethin'
I hold on to the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?

'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
What happened? Please, tell me
'Cause, one second, it was perfect
Now you're halfway out the door


[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all

And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""

And it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say somethin' way too honest, made you run and hide

Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing

Here's to silence that cuts me to the core

Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore


[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all

You flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

[Post-Chorus]
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so
Oh, oh-woah
Oh, oh-oh

[Bridge]
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

Back up, baby, back up
Please, back up, oh, back up
Back up, baby, back up

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called

And then you feel so low you can't feel nothin' at all

You flashback to when we said, ""Forever and always""
And it rains in your bedroom, everythin' is wrong
It rains when you're here, it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


[Outro]
You didn't mean it, baby
You said, ""Forever and always,"" yeah"

Better Than Revenge (Live/2011) Lyrics
[Intro]
""Hey, it's me, leave a message: make it hot""
Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did


[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer, and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it

I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling, and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
But they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
No amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)


[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Woah, woah-ah-oh
Come on, come on

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge


[Outro]
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say ""Sabotage"""

Evermore [Liner Notes] Lyrics
Prologue

To put it plainly, we just couldn't stop writing songs. To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music.
 We chose to wander deeper in and my collaborators and I are proud to announce that my 9th studio album and folklore's sister record is here. It's called evermore.

I've never done this before. In the past I've always treated albums as onе-off eras and moved onto planning the nеxt one as soon as an album was released. There was something different with folklore.
 In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found. So I just kept writing them. And I loved creating these songs with Aaron Dessner, Jack Antonoff, WB
, and Justin Vernon. We've also welcomed some new (and longtime) friends to our musical kitchen table this time around...


Before I knew it there were 17 tales
, some of which are mirrored or intersecting with one another.
 The one about two young con artists who fall in love while hanging out at fancy resorts trying to score rich romantic beneficiaries.
 The one where longtime college sweethearts had very different plans for the same night, one to end it and one who brought a ring.
 Dorothea, the girl who left her small town to chase down Hollywood dreams - and what happens when she comes back for the holidays and rediscovers an old flame.
 The 'unhappily ever after' anthology of marriages gone bad that includes infidelity, ambivalent toleration, and even murder. The most righteous motive, to avenge the fallen.
 The realization that maybe the only path to healing is to wish happiness on the one who took it away from you.
 One starring my grandmother, Marjorie, who still visits me sometimes...if only in my dreams.


I wanted to surprise you with this the week of my 31st birthday. You've all been so caring, supportive and thoughtful on my birthdays and so this time I wanted to give you something! I also know this holiday season will be a lonely one for most of us
 and of there are any of you out there who turn to music to cope with missing loved ones the way I do, this is for you.

I have no idea what will come next. I have no idea about a lot of things these days and so I've clung to the one thing that keeps me connected to you all. That thing always has and always will be music.

And may it continue, evermore."

The Life of a Showgirl (Track by Track) Lyrics
[Spoken]
The last song on this album is the title track, ""The Life of a Showgirl."" It is the story of a fictional showgirl named Kitty and how my character in the song goes to see her perform and is completely inspired by her, but rather than responding with like fakeness, she, she tells me l— she tells it like it is and she kind of warns me off this lifestyle because it’s much more than just the glitter and the glamor. There's a lot else that comеs with it. So it's kind of an ode to show business and the womеn who moved through those pitfalls and obstacle courses. I thought, ""Who better to ask to be a part of this song than the ultimate showgirl, Sabrina Carpenter?"" And thankfully, she said yes, and she’s absolutely incredible on this song. One thing that I really love about the ending of it is that we actually ended the song with actual crowd noise from my last Eras Tour show in Vancouver. So that always chokes me up because it transports me right back to that actual memory of standing on that stage for the last time on that tour. That was so important to me and the tour that really inspired this album. So it's the last track of the album and a really special one to me."

Dear John (Live/2011) Lyrics
Live version of Taylor’s song, Dear John, on the Speak Now World Tour.
[Verse 1]
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you

Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain

And I lived in your chess game
But you changed your rules everyday

Wonderin' which version of you I might get on the phone, tonight
Well I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda' known

[Verse 2]
Well maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""



[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games
When I loved you so?
I shoulda' known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at sorry
And keeping the lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests

All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches
Before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks
Over your sad empty town, yeah-yeah
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home


[Outro]
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress
Wrote you a song, you shoulda' known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda' known"

Lover [Foreword] Lyrics
When I found old diaries from my childhood and my teens, they were covered in dust
. I'm not just saying that for poetic effect, they were truly dusty with pictures drawn of first day of school outfits and inspirational quotes I used to retrace over and over to get me through doubtful moments. I'd practice my autograph and tape my guitar picks to the pages. In the entries, I daydreamed on paper and mused about who might ask who to the dance or how nervous I was saying the national anthem at the local baseball game. I frequently and drastically changed my opinions on love, friends, confidence and trust. I vented, described memories in detail, jotted down new song ideas and questioned why I would ever try to shoot for a career I had such a small chance of ever attaining.

But what shocked me the most was how often I wrote down the things I loved. Writing a new song, riding in the car with my mom, the purple-pink skies
 of the soccer field on the walk home, the one night in middle school when none of my friends were fighting, the dazzle of opal necklaces I couldn’t afford gleaming from a department store jewelry case.
 I wrote about tiny details in my life in these diaries from a bygone age with such... wonderment. Intrigue. Romance. I noticed things and decided they were romantic, and so they were.

In life, we grow up and we encounter the nuanced complexities of trying to figure out who to be, how to act, or how to be happy. Like invisible smoke in the room, we wonder what kind of anxiety pushes you forward and what kind ruins your ability to find joy in your life.
 We constantly question our choices, our surroundings, and we beat ourselves up for our mistakes. All the while, we crave romance. We long for those rare, enchanting moments when things just fall into place. Above all else, we really, really want our lives to be filled with love.

I've decided that in this life, I want to be defined by the things I love- not the things I hate, the things I'm afraid of, or the things that haunt me in the middle of the night.
 Those things may be struggles, but they're not my identity. I wish the same for you. May your struggles become inaudible background noise behind the loud, clear voices of those who love and appreciate you. Turn those voices up in the mix in your head. May you take notice of the things in your life that are nice and make you feel safe and maybe even find wonderment in them. May you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later, only to learn all the trials and the tribulations you thought might kill you... didn't. I hope that someday you forget the pain ever existed.
 I hope that if there is a lover in your life, it's someone who deserves you. If that's the case, I hope you treat them with care.

This album is a love letter to love itself- all the captivating, spellbinding, maddening devastating red, blue, gray, golden aspects of it
 (that's why there are so many songs).
In honor of fever dreams, bad boys,
 confessions of love on a drunken night out,
 Christmas lights still hanging in January, guitar string scars on my hands,
 false gods and blind faith,
 memories of jumping into an icy outdoor pool,
 creaks in floorboards and ultraviolet morning light,
 finally finding a friend,
 and opening the curtains to see the clearest, brightest daylight after the darkest night.


We are what we love.

This is Lover."

Enchanted (Live/2011) Lyrics
Live version of Taylor’s song, Enchanted, on the Speak Now World Tour.
[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy

Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room your silhouette
Starts to make it’s way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck

Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey""
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you (Ooh-ooh)

[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends

My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again

These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you


[Breakdown]
Please don't be in love
With someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don’t be in love with someone else
Please don’t have somebody waiting on you
(Oh)
Please don’t be in love with someone else (Oh-oh)


[Chorus 2]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


[Outro]
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody
Waiting on you"

I Can Do It With a Broken Heart (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I can read your mind
""She's having the time of her life""
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(One, two, three, four)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle it
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, and smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart


[Verse 2]
I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
(One, two, three, four)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle it
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, and smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart


[Outro]
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good
And I'm good
'Cause I'm miserable (Haha)
And nobody even knows
Ah, try and come for my job"

​betty (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell

Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him


[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell

Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long


[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you"

the lakes (original version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?

I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones


[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry

I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Verse 2]
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry

I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Bridge]
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it

While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief


[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry

I'm setting off, but not without my muse
Not without you
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry

I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you"

[Verse 1]
Please take down the mistletoe
'Cause I don't want to think about that right now

'Cause everything I want is miles away

In a snow covered little town
My momma's in the kitchen, worrying about me
Season's greetings, hope you're well
Well I'm doing alright
If you were wondering
Lately I can never tell

[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when you were mine


[Verse 2]
I've been doing fine without you, really
Up until the nights got cold

And everybody's here, except you, baby
Seems like everyone's got someone to hold


[Chorus]
But for me it's just a lonely time
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine


[Bridge]
Merry Christmas, everybody
That'll have to be something I just say this year



[Verse 3]
I'll bet you got your mom another sweater
And were your cousins late again?

When you were putting up the lights this year
Did you notice one less pair of hands?


[Chorus]
I know this shouldn't be a lonely time
But there were Christmases when I didn't wonder how you are tonight
'Cause there were Christmases when you were mine


[Outro]
You were mine"

Honey (Track by Track) Lyrics
[Spoken]
'Honey' is a song about how words that have been meant to hurt you in the past can be repurposed by someone who loves you in a way that feels totally different. You know, if the only time you were called honey was when someone was like, that look is not working for you, honey. Like, that is very different than when somebody calls you honey in a sweet way, in a sincere way, in a lovely way. And it's kind of about sort of the idea of healing these old wounds that were caused by certain words that now feel totally lovely and sweet. So I also just love this song. It's such a bop. I just jump around to this song. This one's called 'Honey.'"

Down Bad (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I knew cosmic love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""What if I can't have him?""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
What if I can't have us?
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad
What if I can't have him?
Down bad
What if I can't have him?


[Verse 2]
Did you takе all my old clothes
Just to leave mе here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I was heavenstruck

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""What if I can't have him?"" (What if I can't have him?)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
What if I can't have us?
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)

What if I can't have him? (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)

What if I can't have him?


[Bridge]
I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause what if I was in love?
What if I can't have us?
'Cause what if I was in love?

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""What if I can't have him?"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
What if I can't have us?
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
What if I can't have him? (I'm down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
What if I can't have him?


[Outro]
Like I lost my twin
What if I can't have him?
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
What if I can't have him?"

Wildest Dreams / Enchanted Lyrics
Taylor Swift surprised fans on the 1989 Tour with a mashup of 1989’s “Wildest Dreams” and “Enchanted” from her 2010 album Speak Now.
[Enchanted]
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Wildest Dreams]
He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever, but this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
He said no one has to know what we do
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)


Ooh

[Enchanted]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go

[Wildest Dreams]
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories follow you around (follow you around)
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again, even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
(Even if it's just in your)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)


[Enchanted]
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is sparkling
Don't you let it go, don't you let it go
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go

In your

[Wildest Dreams]
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Wildest dreams (ah ah)
Even if it's just in your

exile (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Justin Vernon]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all

And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall


[Chorus: Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending

You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before


[Post-Chorus: Justin Vernon]
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances

Balancin' on brеaking branches
Those eyеs add insult to injury


[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending

I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door


[Bridge: Justin Vernon, Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out
You never gave no warning sign
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave no warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Justin Vernon]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending

You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door



[Outro: Justin Vernon & Taylor Swift & Both]
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave no warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave no warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
So many signs, so many signs
I, oh, I, oh

[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now


[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more

And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me

Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame



[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do

And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath

Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well
, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all


[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell

Every time you double-cross my mind

You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you

You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show

But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""


[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it all too well (Just between us)
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell

Every time you double-cross my mind

You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show

But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there"

The Trick to Holding On [Poem] Lyrics
Let go of the ones who hurt you
Let go of the ones you outgrow
Let go of the words they hurl your way
as you're walking out the door
The only thing cut and dry
In this hedge-maze life
Is the fact that their words will cut
but your tears will dry

They don't tell you this when you are young
You can't hold on to everything
Can't show up for everyone
You pick your poison
Or your cure
Phone numbers you know by heart
And the ones you don't answer any more

Hold on to the faint recognition in
the eye of a stranger
As it catches you in its lustrous net
How quickly we become intertwined
How wonderful it is to forget
All the times your intuition failed you
But it hasn't killed you yet
Hold on to childlike whims and moonlight
swims and your blazing self-respect


And if you drive the roads of this town
Ones you've gone down so many times before
Flashback to all the times
Life nearly ran you off the road

But tonight your hand is steady
Suddenly you'll know
The trick to holding on
Was all that letting go"

Sunshine Lyrics
[Verse One]
I walk in the room there's a beautiful sunshine ray
Across the room
Then I hear the phone ring walk to it and I don't know what to say
Hello, good day
But what I do know, is that tonight is gonna be the night, when

[Chorus]
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
When, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
When, I'll say, oh, I'll say I love him too
And, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home listenin' to the radio
And, he says he really loves me too, he'll do anything

[Verse Two]
Oh, I walk through the door there's a beautiful moonlight shine
Across the room
I crawl into bed thinkin' what I did today
With him
But what I do know, is that, I love him too
And the next time I see
Him walking down the street(down the street)
I'll think about this time, that was as beautiful as sunshine, oh

[Chorus]
He says 'I love you' and 'I really care about you'
Yeah, he says he'll hold me in his arms when I'm afraid
And I'll say, I love you too, yeah, I love you
Oh, I'll say, I care about you, yeah, this ain't no charade
Then he'll drive me home, listenin' to the radio
Then, he says, he really loves me and he'll do anything


[Bridge]
I look in his brown eyes, and see a surprise
It's like a present that you open
Oh, and do you know, oh, do you know
What that surprise is?
It's love
And the next time I see him walking down the streets in his old white T-shirt, I'll always remember
This time, that was as beautiful as sunshine

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh, sunshine, oh, oh, oh, sunshine
Sunshine, sunshine, was as beautiful as sunshine"

[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus]
She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do (Why I do)
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

Angelina's got a pretty face
And really long brown hair
Lives somewhere in some wide open space
I've never been there
I guess some people come around and purpose she
But I don't cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess
I'm fine just a bit of a mess
And I'm not perfect you could say

[Verse 2]
Just watched Stephen run across the field

Watched him catch the ball
He's got everything you'd wanna be
He's funny, dark and tall
Watch him run across to Angelina
But I won't cause

I have always been a bit reckless
And I am not your typical princess

Tripped over my two feet hey oh yeah

Better Man Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I know, I'm probably better off on my own
Than loving a man who didn't know what we had when we had it
And I see, the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

[Verse 2]
I wish it wasn't 4AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it,""
I know, the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus]
Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
[Verse 3]
I know, I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping they might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning


[Verse 4]
But your jealousy
Oh, I can hear it now
Talkin' down to me, like I'd always be around
Pushed my love away
Like it was some kinda loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run


[Chorus]
Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

[Bridge]
I hold onto this pride because these days, it's all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Liz Huett]
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would've been the one if you were a better man, yeah, yeah, yeah
Sometimes in the middle of the night I can feel you again
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man
(Sometimes in the middle of the night, I can feel you again)
We might still be in love if you were a better man
(I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man)
Yeah, I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man

We might still be in love if you were a better man

Me and Britney Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Me and Britney used to sit on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking 'bout things no one else was ever supposed to hear
In the summer shade
She said she was gonna be a movie star
And I said she was crazy
Catching dreams and fireflies in a jar
Just me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
We were babies, we were beautiful and free
Oh, oh
There was nothing that was out of reach
For me and Britney

[Verse 2]
She never made it to Hollywood but she made it to Memphis
And this little old town just hasn’t been the same since
That boy she ran off with, well, I thought he was crazy
Maybe I was just jealous that he'd come between me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
She was in love, she was beautiful and free
Oh, oh
She was always so much braver than me


[Bridge]
When the phone rang in the middle of the night
Before she said a word I knew it was her
She said I’m sorry for waking you up but I didn’t know who else to call
Or where else to go

[Verse 3]
Me and Britney sat down on the front porch
Talking about love and how it changes things
Changes people and it changes names and everything but me and Britney

[Chorus]
Oh, oh
We’re not as young, but we’re still beautiful and free
Oh, oh
Even when we’re old, we’re still going to be

[Outro]
Me and Britney sitting on the front porch drinking lemonade
Talking about things no one else is ever gonna hear
In the summer shade"

Can’t Stop Loving You (Live Lounge) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
Got your ticket
Got your suitcase
Got your leaving smile
I could say that's the way it goes
And I could pretend and you won't know
That I was lying

[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Verse 2]
We took a taxi to the station, not a word was said
And I saw you walk across the road
For maybe the last time I don't know
Feeling humble
I heard a rumble
On the railway tracks
And when I hear that whistle blow
I walk away and you won't know
That I was crying


[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?

[Bridge]
And I'll always be by your side
'Cause I never wanted to say goodbye
And I'll always be here, be here if you change, change your mind
And I'll always be by your side
And I never wanted to say goodbye
And I'll always be here, be here if you change, change your mind

[Verse 3]
So you're leaving in the morning on the early train
I could say everything's alright
And I could pretend and say goodbye
But that would be lying

[Chorus]
Cause I can't stop loving you
No I can't stop loving you
No I won't stop loving you
Why should I?


[Post-Chorus]
And I'll always be by your side (Cause I can't stop loving you)
And I never wanted to say goodbye (No I can't stop loving you)
And I'll always be here, be here (No I won't stop loving you)
If you change, change your mind (Why should I?)
(Cause I can't stop loving you) Cause I can't stop
I'll always be here by your side
(No I can't stop loving you) I never wanted to say goodbye
(No I won't stop loving you) I'll always be here
(Why should I?) If you change, change your mind
Why should I?

[Outro]
Why should I even try?
I'll always be here by your side
I didn't want to say goodbye
So why should I even try?"

I'm a laid back
T-shirt, blue jean, mood ring kinda girl
Hey, yeah, what's the word on you?
Lay low
I'm a mission rebel, angel devil
Little left of the middle
Sometimes I get temperamental

But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me

I'm poetry
Complicated, simply stated
Hey, yeah, baby, how about you?
I was born free
I'm a cell phone hippie
Are you with me?
When I mess up, I don't get up
I just get down, yeah

But here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see

It's raining on Sunday
There's nothin' on TV
Yesterday was lonely
You're the only one who gets me
My mind is like an island
Drifting through the ocean
I can't stop thinkin' about you
I bet you're thinkin' of me too

[Chorus]
Well, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside
Oh, what you get is what you see
Baby, you hold the key
To the diary of me
Yeah, here I am, an open book
Turn the page, it's all the rage
Get a look on the inside

The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the hell was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like

[Chorus]
And I don’t even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Verse 2]
You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You’d treat hеr like an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any mеasure of a man


[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Bridge]
Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, ""Good riddance""
'Cause it wasn’t sexy once it wasn’t forbidden
I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won’t get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars

You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing

[Outro]
And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I’ll never forgive
The smallest man who ever lived"

Look at you, look at me
Look at who we could be
I want to know who you are
What you want from the stars
And every time I look at you, I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin, and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me, I could go crazy, but I don't
Say it, but I won't
'Cause I'd rather be alone than lose you


[Chorus]
And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight

And I could tell you now
But baby, never mind

All the time, everyday
There's nothing I can do, baby, to make it go away
So look at you, and look at me
And think of who we could be
But every time I look at you, I can hardly say a thing
My head starts to spin, and it hits me then
I love you
And every time you look at me, I could go crazy, but I don't
Say it, but I won't

And all I really want to do is be next to you
But I'm too tired to fight

But how could you understand?
What happens if you turn away
And everything turns blue and gray?

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream there in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad move, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it
 (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

Takin' it slow, out the window

And it's ooh, woah-oh

It's cool, that's what I tеll 'em
No rules in breakablе heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not lying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

So cut the headlights, summertime life
I'm always waiting for you just to leave me alone
Devils roll the dice (Dice), angels roll their eyes (Eyes)
And if I cry, you'll be the last to know, oh

No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

And I cried like a baby comin' from where you are (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

Anti-Hero Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my obsession works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my schеming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm thе problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a little baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Straight through the heart, but never thrilled


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law does it for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us as well""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

Brought Up That Way Lyrics
“Brought Up That Way” is one of Taylor Swift’s unreleased songs, which tells the story of a widowed father and his daughter.
[Verse 1]
Emily comes home from school
Grabs onto her daddy's hand
He says ""Baby girl, what's wrong with you?""
She says ""Please don't make me go back there again""

She said ""I wish there was some way to make them stop it""
So he drives down to that principal's office and says

[Chorus]
""I didn't bring her up so they could cut her down
I didn't bring her here so they could shut her out
I live my whole damn life to see that little girl's smile
So why are tears pouring down that sweet face?
She wasn't brought up that way""

[Verse 2]
Emily's home late again
He sees that boy drive away
Oh, but something's different this time
She doesn't have too much to say
She said ""He tried but there's just some things I won't do""

And through the tears she said ""I couldn't do that to you""
And he said

[Chorus]
""I didn't bring you up so he could wear you down
Take that innocent heart and turn it inside out
I live my whole damn life to see my little girl's smile
So don't let nobody take that away
You weren't brought up that way""



[Verse 3]
The phone rings on a rainy night, says ""It's Officer Tate""
He said ""Sir, there's been an accident
You better come down here right away
A drunken driver missed an overpass
And Emily, she's fading fast""

He says ""God, I didn't bring her up to watch them lay her down
Nearly killed me the day they put her own momma in the ground
Only thing that kept me alive was that little girl's smile

So please don't take that away, it won't be easy taking her today
She wasn't brought up that way""

[Outro]
He stands over the hospital bed
Emily opens her eyes"

Wi$h Li$t (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
They want that yacht life, under chopper blades
They want those bright lights and Balenci' shades
And a fat stack with a baby face
They want it all
They want that complex female character
They want that critical smash Palme d'Or
And an Oscar on their bathroom floor
They want it all


[Pre-Chorus]
And they should have what they want
They deserve what they want
Hope they get what they want


[Chorus]
I just want you, huh
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world they gotta leave us alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)
I just want you


[Verse 2]
They want that freedom, living off the grid
They want those three dogs that they call their kids
And that good surf, no hypocrites
They want it all
They want a contract with Real Madrid
They want that spring break where the clubs were lit
And then that video taken off the internet
They want it all


[Pre-Chorus]
And they should have what they want
They deserve what they want
I hope they get what they want

[Chorus]
I just want you (You, you, yeah), huh
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world they gotta leave us alone, and they do (Ooh), wow
Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop (Hoop)
Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)


[Bridge]
I made wishes on all of the stars
Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot
I thought I had it right, once, twice, but I did not (I did not)
You caught me off my guard
I hope I get what I want (Get what I want)
'Cause I know what I want

[Chorus]
(I just, I just) I just want you, huh (Baby)
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like (Got 'em lookin' like you) you
We tell the world they gotta leave us alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)
I just want you (Ooh)
And we could have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like (You) you
We tell the world they gotta leave us alone, and they do (Yeah), wow
And now you got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish (Wish) list (List)
I just want you"

august (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Salt air and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more

Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine


[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

Ahh-ahh


[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""

So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no


[Chorus]
'Cause I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine

And I can see us twisted in bedsheets

August sipped away like a bottle of wine
You were never mine


[Outro]
You were never mine
Never mine

Do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said, ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""

And then I canceled my plans just in case you'd call
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, hope of it all
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""

Long Live/New Year’s Day Lyrics
[Verse 1: Long Live]
I said remember this moment, in the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the Kings and the Queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus 1: Long Live]
Long live the walls we crashed through

All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge 1: Long Live]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
And hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground


[Verse 2: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus 2: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 3: New Year's Day]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus 3: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day


[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge 2: New Year's Day]
Please, don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please, don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 4: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus 2: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you


[Outro: Long Live & New Year's Day]
And long live (Please, don't ever become a stranger)
The walls we crashed through (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
I had the time of my life (Please, don't ever become a stranger)
With you (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
And long live
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you"

This Is Really Happening Lyrics
“This Is Really Happening” is about a fairytale-esque relationship in which Swift thought she was dreaming. Although she never released it, she gave it to Britni Hoover, who released her version in 2007. … Read More 
[Verse 1]
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere

Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It's like I'm melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

[Chorus]
Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Verse 2]
Could this be better?
You write me letters
Though you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can't take my eyes off you



[Chorus]
Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Bridge]
All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh, baby, here we are


[Chorus]
Tell me
You'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
Oh, this is really happening
Oh, oh, baby

[Chorus]
Tell me
You'll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening


[Outro]
Tell me, oh
You'll always need me
(Need me, tell me)
(Baby)
That I drive you crazy
(Oh)
That this is really happening"

Just feels like the whole thing is, we're all donkeys

[Spoken: John Higgins & Ben Marshall]
Come on in!

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Hey, what's up, boys!

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Pete in the house

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
Pete man!

[Spoken: Martin Herlihy]
The king of Staten Island himself!


[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
What?

[Spoken: Martin Herlihy]
Nothing, what's up?

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Well, I just wanna say you guys have been making some really fun videos for the show this year


[Spoken: Martin Herlihy]
Dude!

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
Thank you, man! That's very nice

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
It got me thinking, like, we should all do a video together. I had this idea where maybe we could do like a music video about how we're all like best friends and how we're all, like, boys

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
We would be in it with you?

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Yeah, you guys would be the boys, so

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Yeah! Oh my God!

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
I would say so, yeah

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Let's do it!

[Musical Intro: Pete Davidson]
Yo, it's Pete and PDD
Let's go


[Verse 1: Pete Davidson]
Another day in the life of Pete
Just sitting in a courtside seat
People wanna take my picture with selfie sticks
It winds up on Page Six

It's never-ending
Everyday I'm trending
People wanna see the texts that I'm sending
All my friends are cool and famous
Except these three sad virgins

[Chorus: Pete Davidson]
Three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins, whoa
Three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins, whoa

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
Sir, can we time out for a second?

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Yeah, what's going on guys? You having fun?

[Spoken: John Higgins]
I'm having a blast
Quick question, is this about us?


[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Which part?

[Spoken: Martin Herlihy]
I guess the three sad virgins part

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Yeah

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
Because, like, we have had sex
Maybe not super recently but...

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Guys, it's just a parody video, you guys are just playing characters

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Characters...

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
Oh, so people won't think it's about us?

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
It's not about you at all

[Verse 2: Pete Davidson & Ben Marshall]
Their names are Martin, Ben and John
And they work at the show I'm on
They just don't have any swag
(What?)
They're tall and weird and sad
John's loud but not very smart
Ben's breath kinda smells like a fart
And Martin's penis tip is way too red

At least, that's what his doctor said

[Chorus: Pete Davidson & Ben Marshall]
Three sad virgins, what?
He's talking about us
Three sad virgins, whoa

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Oh my god

[Spoken: Martin Herlihy]
Oh, that was my real doctor

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
I gotta say something

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Yeah, you should, yeah

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
Pete!

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
What's up?

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
We love it

[Spoken: John Higgins & Martin Herlihy]
Love it

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
I just had one like tiny thought

[Spoken: John Higgins]
This guy has notes? Leave it as-is
It's rocking, dude

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Hey, do you have an ashtray by any chance?
Oh yeah, thanks

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
My only thing is maybe it could just be like completely different

[Spoken: John Higgins & Martin Herlihy]
Oh

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Oh, okay

[Spoken: Martin Herlihy]
Maybe it's something topical, like Dune's a big movie


[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Oh, something with Dune


[Spoken: John Higgins]
A Dune rap


[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
All right, all right guys
It's now a Dune rap
So let's get some — sand in here!

[Spoken: John Higgins & Ben Marshall]
Yeah

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Alright

[Verse 3: Pete Davidson]
The planet Dune is very nice

It's a world that's made of spice

It's sandy like a playa
With Zendaya

I'm gonna ride a worm

And these guys suck

[Chorus: Pete Davidson]
Three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins on Dune

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Why is he humiliating us?
Ben, why are you dressed as Wendy from Wendy's?

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
Pete made me do it

[Spoken: Martin Herlihy]
And why are we up here?

[Spoken: John Higgins]
He said we're like the flying sad sacks

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
You know what? We can't stand for this, right?

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Yeah!

[Spoken: John Higgins & Martin Herlihy]
Ben! Ben!

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Let us down

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Hey Ben, you ok, dude?

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Are you guys ready to go in again?

[Spoken: Ben Marshall]
No, we can't do this anymore
Okay? It's humiliating

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Damn guys, I'm sorry, I thought that this would be a fun thing for all of us, if it's not, then let's just end it

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Thanks Pete

[Spoken: Martin Herlihy]
Thank you, Pete

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
I mean, after we do the bridge

[Spoken: John Higgins]
Wait, what bridge?

[Spoken: Taylor Swift]
Hey Pete!

[Spoken: Pete Davidson]
Oh, hey Taylor!


[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ben Marshall]
Ben is like a sad Ron Weasley
He looks like if Big Bird lost all his feathers
And Martin has the charm and the sex appeal of a scarecrow
(That's not true!)
John has a big-ass bowling ball head
How does he stay upright with that big, fat melon?
And none of them have the guts to take their shirts off
In front of a girl
(Yeah, that's accurate, true)

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
'Cause they're three sad virgins, what? (Whoa-oh-oh)
Three sad virgins, whoa
Three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins, whoa
Three sad virgins, what?
Three sad virgins, whoa
Three sad virgins, what?

Style Lyrics
This is a cover of Taylor Swift’s “Style,” with a few lyrics altered to be more “gender appropriate.” This actually annoyed many people, and they took to Twitter to voice their complaints.
[Verse 1]
Midnight, you come and pick me up with no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view
It's been a while since I even heard from you
I should just tell you you should leave
I know exactly where it leads
Watch us go around, 'round each time


[Chorus]
You've got that Daydream Nation look in your eye

I got that pent up love thing that you like
And we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style


[Verse 2]
So it goes, I can't keep my eyes on the road
She takes me home, lights are off, she's taking off her coat
I say ""I've heard that you've been out and about with someone new, someone new, someone new""
She says ""What you heard is true
I can't stop thinking about you""
And I've been there far too many times


[Chorus]
You've got that Daydream Nation look in your eye

I got that pent up love thing that you like
And we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

You've got that long brown hair thing that I like
You've got that good girl faith thing, ass so tight

And we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style"

[SANTANA]
You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about


Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Ah-oh-oh

And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
When everything was slippin' right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Ooh, oh
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
I can see it now"

Tim McGraw Lyrics
[Intro]
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me

[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer had gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think my little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me


[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
And it's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, oh it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
Then when you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
Won't you think of me?
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
There's a letter on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
""When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""


[Chorus]
When you think happiness
Hope you think my little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
Oh won't you think of me?
I hope you think of me
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
I hope you think of me
You think of me

[Outro]
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie"""

Long Time Going Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I got a lying smile I never put out for you
'Cause I guess I never felt like I really needed to
And they say little girls have big dreams
And nothing in the world was gonna come between me and you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spent a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it'd be a long time going

[Verse 2]
They say it's better to have lost than never to have loved at all

And I say, whoever said that didn't have too far to fall
And they say little girls are so naive
That wasn't how it was supposed to be with me and you

[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

[Bridge]
I've burned my bridges, had sleepless nights
Washed my sins on the neon lights
And I'm still not over you


[Chorus]
And it was a long time coming
I waited half my life just to find someone like you
I spend a long time finding out love hangs around after you walk out
Not knowing it will be a long time going

[Outro]
A long time going
And it will be a long time, long time going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
It will be a long time, long time going, going
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh"

What Do You Say Lyrics
[Verse 1]
What do you say, when you just know
That he's the one, and you want to go fast
But he's taking it slow?
And what do you do, when he's next to you
But he's a little bit shy?
Well, here's something you can try

[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together?
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

[Verse 2]
What do you see, when you look in his eyes?
There's something there
That he can't disguise
No matter how he tries
And what do you feel, when you know it's real?
And you can't sit still
If you don't own up, will you?


[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together?
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?

[Bridge]
My imagination's running away
Just dreaming about
What I want you to say

[Chorus]
Hey, hey what do you say
We go walking down the river all together?
It's a warm May beautiful day
And I feel like I could
Talk to you forever
With the sun shining bright
It feels just like a day
When everything's going to go just right
I know it will be a sweet memory
For you and me someday
What do you say?
What do you say?

Today Was a Fairytale Lyrics
[Intro]
Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress

You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt

You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around

[Chorus]
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale


[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Bridge]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down


[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

Oh, oh, yeah, oh

Forever & Always (Piano Version) Lyrics
This is simply a piano-based version of Swift’s song “Forever & Always” from her album Fearless. See the original lyrics here. This version of the song captures the raw emotions behind the lyrics.
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye

We caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me

Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me

This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfect

Now you're halfway out the door


[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

[Verse 2]
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest made you run and hide?
Like a scared little boy
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute but I don't anymore


[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
And it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""

[Post-Chorus]
You didn't mean it, baby
I don't think so

[Bridge]
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Please back up, oh back up
Back up, baby, back up

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

And you flashback to when we said, ""Forever and always""
'Cause it rains in your bedroom, everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""


[Outro]
You didn't mean it baby
You said, ""Forever and always"", yeah"

Actually Romantic (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I heard you call me ""Boring Barbie"" when you're out feeling brave
High-fived my ex and then you said you're glad he ghosted me
Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face
Some people might be offended

[Chorus]
But it's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me
It's honestly wild
All the effort you've put in
It's actually romantic
I really gotta hand it to you, ooh
No man has ever loved me like you do

[Verse 2]
Hadn't thought of you in a long time
But you keep sending me funny valentinеs
And I know you think it comes off vicious
But it's precious, adorable
Likе a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse
That's how much it hurts
How many times has your boyfriend said
""Why are we always talking 'bout her?""

[Chorus]
It's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me
It's honestly wild
All the effort you've put in
It's actually romantic
I really gotta hand it to you, ooh
No man has ever loved me like you do


[Bridge]
You think I'm tacky, baby
Stop talking dirty to me
It sounded nasty, but it feels like you're flirting with me
I mind my business, God's my witness that I don't provoke it
It's kind of making me sweat (Oh)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me (Ah)
It's honestly lovely
All the effort you've put in (Ah)
It's actually romantic
Really gotta hand it to you, to you
No man has ever loved me like you do

[Outro]
It's actually romantic (You've just given me so much attention; la-la-la-la)
It's actually romantic
(It's so) Shoo-wop-bop, romantic"

Welcome Distraction Lyrics
One of Taylor Swift’s unreleased songs. She sings about not wanting to get involved in a serious relationship, but evidently falling for a guy that she can’t stay away from.
[Verse 1]
I got a little thing I call self control
'Cause I get a little crazy when I let too much go
Love’s a little messy, and you are too
Right now, I’m scared of both of you
I laugh, and I play, and I wasn’t gonna stray
Swore I’d never let a man in my way
You’re the last thing I needed today

[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name

I can’t win, so I give in
The more I fight, it just gets stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction

[Verse 2]
Gone and spilled my coffee tryna get to the phone
'Cause it might be you, you just never know
Can’t talk to my friends without you coming up
It’s even kind of cute the way you cuss
I wrote your name down a hundred thousand times
'Cause it looks so good right next to mine

You’re the last thing I needed tonight


[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win, so I give in
The more I fight, it just gets stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction
Welcome distraction

[Bridge]
I’m acting like a girl with nothing to lose
When did I stop caring about anything but you?

[Chorus]
And I don’t know
Where I lost control
And couldn’t take it any longer
Must have been somewhere between
Your smile and the way you say my name
I can’t win, so I give in
The more I fight, it just gets stronger
You’re an inconvenient kind of satisfaction

[Outro]
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction
Welcome distraction, welcome distraction, oh, oh"

loml (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?

We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""

I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed
I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since


[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
You and I go from one kiss to getting married

Still alivе, killing time at the cemеtery
Never quite buried

In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy

You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
You said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell too

And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since



[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life

[Bridge]
You talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried

[Chorus]
Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind""

Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes

And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life"

Ellen works a long day

Giving weird interviews in a slick, cool sweater
And it gets kinda weird

Yeah, calling us like we're boyfriend and girlfriend

But it's not cause we're just sitting here

And we got cat videos
 and dance on Betty White and stuff

And it's always gonna get weird, ha
(Is this just about being weird?)
Cause this song is all about Ellen and Swift, yeah



[Chorus:Zac Efron, Taylor Swift & Zac Efron]
Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
, really weird

All because of Ellen
Every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
, really weird
Always end up dancing


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I've been on this show
Eight times now and I still remember
Ellen hiding in the bathroom with a hidden camera
And she scared me so bad and I fell and I could've died

She's always asks me who I'm dating
Every time I'm on this show

And I don't even know why

But it gets five million hits on YouTube


[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Zac Efron, Zac Efron]
Cause, every single time I come on this show
It's really weird
, really weird

All because of Ellen

Every single time I come on this show

It's really weird
, really weird

Always end up dancing"

American Boy Lyrics
“American Boy” is one of Taylor Swift’s unreleased songs. She sings about an American boy–much like she sang about an American girl–and his endless pursuit of the possibly dead American dream.
[Verse 1]
American boy, living life as it goes
Sitting on the fence posts
Living in the lie
American boy, living in the real world
Trying just to get the girl

Trying to survive

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue

Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was

Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy

[Verse 2]
Living off of bar tips, trying for relationships

Looking for the love
Suddenly rise, an American beauty
Suddenly he cheats, sent from above

[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Sam Hill avenue

Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world can ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy


[Verse 3]
American boy, raising little babies
Hearing daddy maybe, I'll be like you
Suddenly life, seems just like a new dawn
That's grown up, American boy


[Chorus]
The simple things in life are always new
Growing up on Grandview avenue
Mama makes her cookies and daddy's just
The greatest living hero that ever was
Nothing in the world will ever once destroy
No, nothing in the world will ever once destroy
The hope of an American boy"

All Night Diner Lyrics
“All Night Diner” is one of Taylor Swift’s unreleased songs. The song’s imaginative lyrics talk about how she would feel if she didn’t have this boy in her life.
[Verse 1]
I wake up
I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now
Yeah I slept, in my makeup again
Tell myself 'I must be crazy'
Thinkin' 'bout him
I find myself something decent to wear
Take the towel out of my hair

About that time, you call me
And I'm reminded, without you

[Chorus]
I'd be a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote


[Verse 2]
I go to work
Work all day
I'm a walking tape recorder
Of everything you say
Walk to the car, dig out my keys
Start thinkin' if you were with anyone but me



[Chorus]
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote


[Bridge]
There you are
On the street

Just standing there, waiting on me
I show you, my new shoes
You say you love them
'Nd baby without you -

[Chorus]
I'm a stranger in an all night diner
Waiting for a love to find her
Lonely like a harbor light
That's never seen a boat
Like a line in an old love letter
No one ever wrote

I stretch out
I wonder what you're doin' right now"

Better Off Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I live down the street in a broken down house
And a car up on blocks in the driveway
The moment we meet, there was never a doubt
That we won't forget this Sunday
It starts with a smile, and we walk a few miles
And it all leads to this - our first kiss


[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off
You're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble

You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 2]
We drive around town in a rusty old truck
But somehow it feels like we're flying
Don't want to come down

But they make it so tough
Cause everyone we know is trying
To push us apart, hide it down in our hearts
And they get what they want cause you're gone


[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, why are you crying?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
They can talk forever, they just don't know better

[Verse 3]
You come to my door
In the pouring rain
We know what we don't have to say
You hand me a rose and a note that says
We don't have to do things their way, oh


[Chorus]
All my friends are saying
Girl, what are you thinking?
You're better off, you're better off without him
Find yourself another
Girl, that boy is trouble
You're better off, you're better off
Well, they can talk forever, they just don't know better"

2022 New York University Commencement Speech Lyrics
Hi, I'm Taylor. Last time I was in a stadium this size, I was dancing in heels and wearing a glittery leotard.
 This outfit is much more comfortable. I would like to say a huge thank you to NYU's chairman of the board of trustees, Bill Berkley, and all the trustees and members of the board, NYU's president Andrew Hamilton, provost Katherine Fleming, and the faculty and alumni here today who have made this day possible. I feel so proud to share this day with my fellow honorees, Susan Hockfield and Felix Matos Rodriguez, who humble me with the ways they improve our world with their work.

As for me, I'm 90% sure the main rеason I'm here is becausе I have a song called ""22."" And let me just say, I am elated to be here with you today as we celebrate and graduate New York University's Class of 2022. Not a single one of us here today has done it alone. We are each a patchwork quilt of those who have loved us, those who have believed in our futures, those who showed us empathy and kindness, or told us the truth, even when it wasn't easy to hear. Those who told us we could do it when there was absolutely no proof of that. Someone read stories to you, and taught you to dream, and offered up some moral code of right and wrong for you to try and live by. Someone tried their best to explain every concept in this insanely complex world to the child that was you as you asked a bazillion questions, like, ""How does the moon work?"" and ""Why can we eat salad, but not grass?"" And maybe they didn't do it perfectly — no one ever can —, maybe they aren't with us anymore, in that case, I hope you'll remember them today. If they are in this staium, I hope you'll find your own way to express your gratitude for all the steps, and missteps, that have led us to this common destination.

I know that words are supposed to be my thing, but I will never be able to find the words to thank my mom and dad, and my brother, Austin, for the sacrifices they made every day, so I could go from singing in coffeehouses to standing up here with you today, because no words would ever be enough. To all the incredible parents, family members, mentors, teachers, allies, friends, and loved ones here today who have supported these students in their pursuit of educational enrichment, let me say to you now: Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you.


I'd like to thank NYU for making me technically, on paper at least, a ""doctor."" Not the type of doctor you would want around in case of an emergency, unless your specific emergency was that you desperately needed to hear a song with a catchy hook and an intensely cathartic bridge section. Or if your emergency was that you needed a person who can name over 50 breeds of cats in one minute.
 I never got to have a ""normal"" college experience, per se. I went to public high school until 10th grade and then finished my education doing homeschool work on the floors of airport terminals. Then, I went on the road for radio tour, which sounds incredibly glamourous, but in reality, it consisted of a rental car, motels, and my mom and I pretending to have loud mother-daughter fights with each other during boarding, so no one would want the empty seat between us on Southwest.

As a kid, I always thought I would go away to college, imagining the posters I would hang on the wall of my freshman dorm. I even set the ending of my music video for my song ""Love Story"" at my fantasy, imaginary college, where I meet a male model reading a book on the grass, and with one single glance, we realize we had been in love in our past lives.
 Which is exactly what you guys all experienced at some point in the last four years, right?

But I really can't complain about not having a normal college experience to you, because you went to NYU during a global pandemic, being essentially locked into your dorms and having to do classes over Zoom. Everyone in college during normal times stresses about test scores, but on top of that, you also had to pass, like, a thousand COVID tests. I imagine the idea of a normal college experience was all you wanted, too, but in this case, you and I both learned that you don't always get all the things in the bag that you selected from the menu in the delivery service that is life. You get what you get. And as I would like to say to you, wholeheartedly, you should be very proud of what you've done with it. Today, you leave New York University and then go out into the world, searching what's next. And so will I.

So, as a rule, I try not to give anyone unsolicited advice, unless they ask for it. I'll go into this more later. I guess I have been officially solicited in this situation to impart whatever wisdom I might have to tell you things that have helped me so far in my life. Please, bear in mind that I, in no way, feel qualified to tell you what to do. You've worked, and struggled, and sacrificed, and studied, and dreamed your way here today, and so you know what you're doing. You'll do things differently than I did them and for different reasons. So, I won't tell you what to do, 'cause no one likes that. I will, however, give you some life hacks I wish I knew when I was starting out my dreams of a career and navigating life, love, pressure, choices, shame, hope, and friendship.

The first of which is: Life can be heavy, especially if you try to carry it all at once. Part of growing up and moving into new chapters of your life is about catch and release. What I mean by that is knowing what things to keep and what things to release. You can't carry all things, all grudges, all updates on your ex, all enviable promotions your school bully got at the hedge fund his uncle started. Decide what is yours to hold and let the rest go. Oftentimes, the good things in your life are lighter anyway, so there's more room for them. One toxic relationship can outweigh so many wonderful simple joys. You get to pick what your life has time and room for. Be discerning.

Secondly: Learn to live alongside cringe. No matter how hard you try to avoid being cringe, you will look back on your life and cringe, retrospectively. Cringe is unavoidable over a lifetime, even the term cringe might someday be deemed ""cringe."" I promise you, you're probably doing or wearing something right now that you will look back on later and find revolting and hilarious. You can't avoid it, so don't try to. For example, I had a phase where, for the entirety of 2012, I dressed like a 1950s housewife. But you know what? I was having fun.
 Trends and phases are fun. Looking back and laughing is fun.

And while we're talking about things that make us squirm, but really shouldn't, I'd like to say I'm a big advocate for not hiding your enthusiasm for things. It seems to me that there is a false stigma around eagerness in our culture of unbothered ambivalence. This outlook perpetuates the idea that it's not cool to want it; the people who don't try are fundamentally more chic than people who do. And I wouldn't know, because I am a lot of things, but I've never been expert on chic, but I'm the one who's up here, so you have to listen to me when I say this. Never be ashamed of trying. Effortlessness is a myth. The people who wanted it the least were the ones I wanted to date, and be friends with in high school. The people who want it the most are the people I now hire to work for my company.

I started writing songs when I was 12, and since then, it's been the compass guiding my life, and in turn, my life guided my writing. Everything I do is just an extension of my writing, whether it's directing videos, or a short film
, creating the visuals for a tour, or standing on a stage performing. Everything is connected by my love of the craft, the thrill of working through ideas, narrowing them down, polishing it up in the end, editing, waking up in the middle of the night, throwing out an old idea because you thought of a newer, better one, or a plot device that ties it all together. There's a reason they call it a hook: Sometimes a string of words just ensnares me and I can't focus on anything until it's been recorded or written down.


As a songwriter, I've never been able to sit still or stay in one place for too long. I've made and released 11 albums and, in the process, I've switched genre from country to pop to alternative to folk, and this might sound like a very songwriter centric line of discussion, but in a way, I really do think we are all writers. And most of us write in a different voice for different situations. You write differently in your Instagram stories than you do your senior thesis; you send a different type of email to boss than you do to your best friend from home. We are all literary chameleons and I think it's fascinating — it's a continuation of the idea that we are many things all the time. And I know it can be very overwhelming figuring out who to be and when, who you are now and how to act in order to get where you want to go.

I have some good news: It's totally up to you. I have some terrifying news: It's totally up to you.


I said to you earlier that I don't ever offer advice unless someone asks for it, and now I'll tell you why. As a person who started my very public career at the age of 15, it came with a price, and that price was years of unsolicited advice. Being the youngest person in every room for over a decade meant that I was constantly being issued warnings from older members of the music industry, media, interviewers, executives. And this advice often presented itself as thinly veiled warnings.

See, I was a teenager at a time when our society was absolutely obsessed with the idea of having perfect young female role models. It felt like every interview I did included slight barbs by the interviewer about me one day ""running off the rails,"" and that meant a different thing to every person who said it to me. So, I became a young adult while being fed the message that if I didn't make any mistakes, all the children of America would grow up to be perfect angels. However, if I did slip up, the entire Earth would fall off its axis, and it would be entirely fault, and I would go to pop star jail forever and ever. It was all centered around the idea that mistakes equal failure, and ultimately the loss of any chance at a happy or rewarding life.

This has not been my experience. My experience has been that my mistakes led to the best things in my life, and being embarrassed when you mess up is part of the human experience. Getting back up, dusting yourself off, and seeing who still wants to hang out after and laugh about it — that's a gift. The times I was told no, or wasn't included, wasn't chosen, didn't win, didn't make the cut, looking back, it really feels like those moments were as important, if not more crucial than the moments I was told yes.

Not being invited to the parties and sleepovers in my hometown made me feel hopelessly lonely, but because I felt alone I would sit in my room and write the songs that would get me a ticket somewhere else.
 Having label executives in Nashville tell me that only 35-year-old housewives listened to Country music and there was no place for a 13-year-old on their roster made me cry in the car on the way home. But then I'd post my songs on my MySpace — yes, MySpace — and I would message with other teens like me who loved country music, but just didn't have anyone singing from their perspective.

Having journalists write in-depth, oftentimes critical, pieces about who they perceived me to be made me feel like I was living in some weird simulation, but it also made me look inward to learn about who I actually am. Having the world treat my love life like a spectator sport in which I lose every single game was not a great way to date in my teens and twenties, but it taught me to protect my private life fiercely.
 Being publicly humiliated over and over again at a young age was excruciatingly painful, but it forced me to devalue the ridiculous notion of minute-by-minute, ever-fluctuating social relevance and likeability. Getting canceled on the internet and nearly losing my career gave me an excellent knowledge of all the types of wine.

I know I sound like a consummate optimist, but I'm really not. I lose perspective all the time. Sometimes, everything just feels completely pointless. I know the pressure of living your life through the lens of perfectionism. And I know that I'm talking to a group of perfectionists because you are here today graduating from NYU. So this might be hard for you to hear: In your life, you will inevitably misspeak, trust the wrong person, underreact, overreact, hurt the people who didn't deserve it, overthink, not think at all, self-sabotage, create a reality where only your experience exists, ruin perfectly good moments for yourself and others, deny any wrongdoing, not take the steps to make it right, feel very guilty, let the guilt eat at you, hit rock bottom, finally address the pain you caused, try to do better next time, rinse, repeat.

And I'm not going to lie, these mistakes will cause you to lose things. I'm trying to tell you that losing things doesn't just mean losing. A lot of the time, when we lose things, we gain things too. Now, you leave the structure and framework of school and chart your own path. Every choice you make leads to the next choice, which leads to the next, and I know it's hard to know which path to take. There will be times in life when you need to stand up for yourself. Times when the right thing is actually to back down and apologize. Times when the right thing is to fight. Times when the right thing is to turn and run.
 Times to hold on with all you have, and times to let go with grace.
 Sometimes the right thing to do is to throw out the old schools of thought in the name of progress and reform. Sometimes the right thing to do is to sit and listen to wisdom to those who have come before us. How will you know what the right choice is in these crucial moments? You won't. How do I give advice to this many people about their life choices? I won't. The scary news is, you're on your own now. But the cool news is, you're on your own now.


I leave you with this: We are led on our gut instincts, our intuition, our desires and fears, our scars, and our dreams. And you will screw it up sometimes. So will I, and when I do, you will most likely read about it on the internet. Anyway, hard things will happen to us, we will recover, we will learn from it, we will grow more resilient because of it, and as long as we are fortunate enough to be breathing, we will breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, and breathe out.
 And I am a doctor now, so I know how breathing works. I hope you know how proud I am to share this day with you. We're doing this together, so let's just keep dancing like we're the class of '22."

Santa Baby Lyrics
Taylor Swift covers a classic 1953 Christmas song originally by Eartha Kitt. This has been covered by many artists over the decades.
[Chorus]
Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me

I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue

Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah

[Verse 1]
Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list

[Chorus]
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot

I have been an angel all year, Santa baby

So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight


[Verse 2]
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's

I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me


[Chorus]
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
A ring
And I don't mean on the phone
, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight"

Wait for Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If you had only gotten to me first
If I could write a book on how this hurts
If you could see the way your smile looks to me

If I wasn't scared of the world alone
If I didn't know he loves me so
If I could only find the strength to leave
You'd be with me, so baby

[Chorus]
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me


[Verse 2]
It's so wrong that all I wanna do
Is forget it all and just be with you
I have to go 'cause he don't know
But the writing's on the wall
But here we are in so deep, soaking wet
Jumping in without no safety net
And I don't know what kinda ropes
Would break this kinda fall, so baby



[Chorus]
Don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go, I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait, wait for me


[Bridge]
We can't be together right now
Guess there's no use in trying
But if you look at me right now
Can you tell that I'm dying
To hold you
But it would be wrong to

[Chorus]
So don't you look in my eyes
I might fall in love
With a beautiful boy
I wish that I could touch
You go I hope you think of me
As the stars fall down and the heavens fade
This girl is begging wait for me



[Outro]
Don't you look now
Don't you look now
I might fall in love
Don't you look now"

Drops of Jupiter (Live/2011) Lyrics
[Spoken Intro]
You know, you guys have a lot of amazing bands from this part of the world, did you know that?

[Verse 1]
Well, now he's back in the atmosphere
With drops of Jupiter in his hair, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
He walks like summer and talks like rain
Reminds me that there's time to change, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
But since his return from the stay on the moon
He listens like spring and he talks like June, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey


[Chorus]
Tell me, did you sail across the sun?
Did you make it to the Milky Way
To see the lights are faded
That heaven is overrated?

Tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?


[Verse 2]
Well, now he's back from that soul vacation
Chasing his way through the constellation, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
He checks out Mozart while he does Tae-Bo
Reminds me that there's a room to grow, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Well, now he's back in the atmosphere
I'm afraid that he might think of me as
Plain ol' Jane told a story about a man
Who is too afraid to fly so he never did land



[Chorus]
Tell me, did this wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along in the light of day
Head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did Venus blow your mind?
Was it everything you wanted to find?
And did you miss me
While you were looking for yourself out there?


[Refrain]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze-dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte you have ever had, and me?


[Chorus]
Tell me, did the wind sweep you off your feet?
Did you finally get the chance
To dance along in the light of day, hey
Head back to the Milky Way?
And tell me, did you fall for a shooting star?
One without a permanent scar?
And did you miss me while you were
Looking for yourself?



[Interlude]
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh


[Refrain]
Can you imagine no love, pride, deep-fried chicken
Your best friend always sticking up for you
Even when I know you're wrong?
Can you imagine no first dance, freeze dried romance
Five-hour phone conversation
The best soy latte that you ever had, and me?

But Daddy I Love Him (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want


[Verse 2]
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay away from her""
The saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

[Chorus]
And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want


[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this gripin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice

[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but, it's over


[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

[Outro]
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not
But you should see your faces
But, oh my God, you should see your faces
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
(He was chaos, he was revelry)"

Stupid Boy Lyrics
“Stupid Boy” is an angsty track written by Taylor in her early teens. It hasn’t been officially released, but it can be found online with some searching.
[Verse 1]
Let me know, how's it feel
To be under my skin, wrapped around my heart
Is it like anywhere you've been?

And everything I do, I do it just for you


[Chorus]
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy


[Verse 2]
I have been looking in, trying to read your mind
Give you the benefit of the doubt, every single time
And then you walk right by, I'm screaming out inside

[Chorus]
Why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy



[Bridge]
What happens when you wake up, to see that you've lost?
You take one look at me, cause that's what it cost

I just wanna be everything you need
Cause you're everything to me

[Chorus]
So why the hell don't you love me?
Why the hell don't you need me like I need you?
Why you so far above me?
Don't you know that there's nothing I wouldn't do?
But I was just a toy, which you destroyed
Stupid boy

Back to December (Acoustic) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time
You saw me is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die


[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives

And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love till it hurts or bleeds, or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannon ball
Now all we know, is don’t let go
We are alone just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong

We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight

Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate

You’re my Achilles heel

This is the golden age of something good
And right and real

[Chorus]
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same
And I never saw you coming
And I’ll never be the same

This is a state of grace
This is a worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game

In the Pouring Rain Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I loved you for a little, a little while
I think you know that!
It would have worked for a little
Except for that day you...
It's not like you to be here
When you said you won't!

[Chorus]
But in the pouring rain

You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!

It's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain

[Verse 2]
It kills me to say this
It really does, it kills my heart!
But I might still love you
Reason we're just fallen apart
But it's not like me to answer
Gonna change my mind!

But, in the pouring rain
You changed everything
You changed the tune!
In the middle of the game
You changed everything
You changed the rules!
And it's not like we could forget something quickly
Except in the pouring rain

[Bridge]
Oh, am I...
All I torn myself I would be losing!
But in the pouring rain, can you feel my pain?
My tears are falling down from the sky!
In the pouring rain, I can feel...
I wonder who you love tonight

Oh, in the pouring rain
In the pouring rain
Oh, in the pouring rain!

You changed my mind"

Just South of Knowing Why Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She didn't have a reason to go, oh no
She didn't have a reason to stay
Either way she didn't tell anyone about her first ray of sun
She looked at her keys and found a reason to run


[Pre-Chorus]
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
But I understand it somehow

[Chorus]
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

[Verse 2]
I didn't really know her that well
But I could tell that her smile was only something to hide behind
She felt so out of touch, because she just felt too much
If you don't know what you want nothing's ever enough

[Pre-Chorus]
And time stands still when you're nowhere bound
That's where I'm headed right now


[Chorus]
If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by, just south of knowing why

[Verse 3]
I don't have a plan, I don't have a map
I don't even know if I'm ever going back
I don't have a when and I don't have a where
I don't even know if I'll know when I'm there


[Chorus]
But If I could drive all night would I find my peace of mind?
Would it be a million miles of cold white lies
And unfamiliar exit signs?
I just drive on by

[Verse 4]
I just drive on by, drive on, drive on
Drive all night
If I drive on, drive on, drive on
Drive all night, just south of knowing why"

I Did Something Bad (Reputation Tour Remix) Lyrics
[Intro]
I never trust a narcissist
Oh but they love me...
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy...
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about...
...me...

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Verse]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me

They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left


[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing""
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good
It just felt so good

They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
And it's just for fun

They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got pitchforks and proof, they don't need their reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
So light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (light me up)
Light me up (light me up), light me up (light me up)

Light me up ohh
Light me up, light me up, light me up
Go ahead and light me up...


[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Outro]
Oh, they say I did something bad
Why's it feel so good, good?
It just felt so good, good"

Smokey Black Nights Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand

And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 1]
I've seen a million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want to speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Verse 2]
Still through the haze I can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand

And I saw that sunset gleaming as my eyes went wild
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 2]
I've played a thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want to sing to you
Waited on a wire
Staring at the fire
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights


[Chorus 3]
I've walked a thousand miles
Smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with you

Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Outro]
So walk with me as the sweet wind dances
I'll write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights"

Live for the Little Things Lyrics
[Verse 1]
One daybreak, one heartache
Every once upon a time
That black dress, happiness

Bubble baths and quarter lines

[Pre-Chorus]
They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one

[Chorus]
Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

[Verse 2]
Oil paintings and making
Every detail turn out bad
One last stands, new romance
Living for that love and person

[Pre-Chorus]
They mean so much to everyone
But you count them up one by one


[Chorus]
Clear midnights and this spotlight
Once thinking that your dad was ten feet tall
A blue bonnet, a braid on it
Quiet winters and leaves that always fall
Your black boots, my red flower ring
Live for the little things

Ohh, yeah
Ohh

[Bridge]
No fighting, black riding
Wish upon a star and give the moon a smile
Pretending, defending
Take a risk and go along for the ride
Strawberries and fairies with wings
Live for the little things

[Outro]
Na na na...
Oh, yeah
Na na na...
Ohh, yeah
Na na na..."

Your Anything Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I bet you lie awake at night
Trying to make up your sweet mind
Wondering if you'll ever find
Just what you want
A home-town number one
Or a California loaded gun
But you know you only get one
Or that's what you thought
But here's what you've got

[Chorus]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need
I'd give everything to be your anything


[Verse 2]
If you want hard to get
If you want
All you have to do is let me know
If you want a bumpy ride
Or someone with a softer side
Either one will be alright
Just let me know
Cause this is where it goes



[Chorus]

[Bridge]
It's not like I'm giving up who I am for you
But for someone like you it's just so easy to do

[Chorus]
I could be your favorite blue jeans
With the holes in the knees
In the bottom of the top drawer
I could be your little beauty queen
Just a little outta reach
Or the girl living next door
I'll be your angel giving up her wings
If that's what you need

If that's what you need

30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-30-things-i-learned-before-turning-30-annotated,"8 Contributors
30 Things I Learned Before Turning 30 Lyrics
According to my birth certificate, I turn 30 this year. It's weird because part of me still feels 18 and part of me feels 283, but the actual age I currently am is 29. I've heard people say that your thirties are ""the most fun!"" So I'll definitely keep you posted on my findings on that when I know. But until then, I thought I'd share some lessons I've learned before reaching 30, because it's 2019 and sharing is caring.

Lesson 1

I learned to block some of the noise. Social media can be great, but it can also inundate your brain with images of what you aren't, how you're failing, or who is in a cooler locale than you at any given moment. One thing I do to lessen this weird insecurity laser beam is to turn off comments. Yes, I keep comments off on my posts. That way, I'm showing my friends and fans updates on my life, but I'm training my brain to not need the validation of someone telling me that I look 🔥🔥🔥. I'm also blocking out anyone who might feel the need to tell me to ""go die in a hole ho"" while I'm having my coffee at nine in the morning. I think it's healthy for your self-esteem to need less internet praise to appease it
, especially when three comments down you could unwittingly see someone telling you that you look like a weasel that got hit by a truck and stitched back together by a drunk taxidermist. An actual comment I received once.

Lesson 2

Being sweet to everyone all the time can get you into a lot of trouble. While it may be born from having been raised to be a polite young lady, this can contribute to some of your life's worst regrets if someone takes advantage of this trait in you.
 Grow a backbone, trust your gut, and know when to strike back. Be like a snake—only bite if someone steps on you.

Lesson 3

Trying and failing and trying again and failing again is normal.
 It may not feel normal to me because all of my trials and failures are blown out of proportion and turned into a spectator sport by tabloid takedown culture (you had to give me one moment of bitterness, come on). BUT THAT SAID, it's good to mess up and learn from it and take risks. It's especially good to do this in your twenties because we are searching. That's GOOD. We'll always be searching but never as intensely as when our brains are still developing at such a rapid pace. No, this is not an excuse to text your ex right now. That's not what I said. Or do it, whatever, maybe you'll learn from it. Then you'll probably forget what you learned and do it again.... But it's fine; do you, you're searching.

Lesson 4

I learned to stop hating every ounce of fat on my body. I worked hard to retrain my brain that a little extra weight means curves, shinier hair, and more energy.
 I think a lot of us push the boundaries of dieting, but taking it too far can be really dangerous. There is no quick fix. I work on accepting my body every day.

Lesson 5

Banish the drama. You only have so much room in your life and so much energy to give to those in it. Be discerning. If someone in your life is hurting you, draining you, or causing you pain in a way that feels unresolvable, blocking their number isn't cruel. It's just a simple setting on your phone that will eliminate drama if you so choose to use it.

Lesson 6

I've learned that society is constantly sending very loud messages to women that exhibiting the physical signs of aging is the worst thing that can happen to us. These messages tell women that we aren't allowed to age. It's an impossible standard to meet, and I've been loving how outspoken Jameela Jamil has been on this subject. Reading her words feels like hearing a voice of reason amongst all these loud messages out there telling women we're supposed to defy gravity, time, and everything natural in order to achieve this bizarre goal of everlasting youth that isn't even remotely required of men.


Lesson 7

My biggest fear. After the Manchester Arena bombing and the Vegas concert shooting, I was completely terrified to go on tour this time because I didn't know how we were going to keep 3 million fans safe over seven months. There was a tremendous amount of planning, expense, and effort put into keeping my fans safe.
 My fear of violence has continued into my personal life. I carry QuikClot army grade bandage dressing, which is for gunshot or stab wounds. Websites and tabloids have taken it upon themselves to post every home address I've ever had online. You get enough stalkers trying to break into your house and you kind of start prepping for bad things. Every day I try to remind myself of the good in the world, the love I've witnessed and the faith I have in humanity. We have to live bravely in order to truly feel alive, and that means not being ruled by our greatest fears.


Lesson 8

I learned not to let outside opinions establish the value I place on my own life choices. For too long, the projected opinions of strangers affected how I viewed my relationships. Whether it was the general internet consensus of who would be right for me, or what they thought was ""couples goals"" based on a picture I posted on Instagram. That stuff isn't real. For an approval seeker like me, it was an important lesson for me to learn to have my OWN value system of what I actually want.

Lesson 9

I learned how to make some easy cocktails like Pimm's cups, Aperol spritzes, Old-Fashioneds, and Mojitos because…2016.


Lesson 10

I've always cooked a LOT, but I found three recipes I know I'll be making at dinner parties for life: Ina Garten's Real Meatballs and Spaghetti (I just use packaged bread crumbs and only ground beef for meat), Nigella Lawson's Mughlai Chicken, and Jamie Oliver's Chicken Fajitas with Molé Sauce.
 Getting a garlic crusher is a whole game changer. I also learned how to immediately calculate Celsius to Fahrenheit in my head. (Which is what I'm pretty sure the internet would call a ""weird flex."")


Lesson 11

Recently I discovered Command tape, and I definitely would have fewer holes in my walls if I'd hung things that way all along. This is not an ad. I just really love Command tape.

Lesson 12

Apologizing when you have hurt someone who really matters to you takes nothing away from you. Even if it was unintentional, it's so easy to just apologize and move on. Try not to say ""I'm sorry, but..."" and make excuses for yourself. Learn how to make a sincere apology, and you can avoid breaking down the trust in your friendships and relationships.


Lesson 13


It's my opinion that in cases of sexual assault, I believe the victim.
 Coming forward is an agonizing thing to go through. I know because my sexual assault trial was a demoralizing, awful experience. I believe victims because I know firsthand about the shame and stigma that comes with raising your hand and saying ""This happened to me."" It's something no one would choose for themselves. We speak up because we have to, and out of fear that it could happen to someone else if we don't.


Lesson 14

When tragedy strikes someone you know in a way you've never dealt with before, it's okay to say that you don't know what to say. Sometimes just saying you're so sorry is all someone wants to hear. It's okay to not have any helpful advice to give them; you don't have all the answers. However, it's not okay to disappear from their life in their darkest hour. Your support is all someone needs when they're at their lowest point. Even if you can't really help the situation, it's nice for them to know that you would if you could.

Lesson 15

Vitamins make me feel so much better! I take L-theanine, which is a natural supplement to help with stress and anxiety. I also take magnesium for muscle health and energy.

Lesson 16

Before you jump in headfirst, maybe, I don't know...get to know someone!
 All that glitters isn't gold, and first impressions actually aren't everything. It's impressive when someone can charm people instantly and own the room, but what I know now to be more valuable about a person is not their charming routine upon meeting them (I call it a ""solid first 15""), but the layers of a person you discover in time. Are they honest, self-aware, and slyly funny at the moments you least expect it? Do they show up for you when you need them?
 Do they still love you after they've seen you broken?
 Or after they've walked in on you having a full conversation with your cats as if they're people? These are things a first impression could never convey.

Lesson 17

After my teen years and early twenties of sleeping in my makeup and occasionally using a Sharpie as eyeliner (DO NOT DO IT), I felt like I needed to start being nicer to my skin.
 I now moisturize my face every night and put on body lotion after I shower, not just in the winter, but all year round, because, why can't I be soft during all the seasons?!

Lesson 18

Realizing childhood scars and working on rectifying them. For example, never being popular as a kid was always an insecurity for me. Even as an adult, I still have recurring flashbacks of sitting at lunch tables alone or hiding in a bathroom stall, or trying to make a new friend and being laughed at. In my twenties I found myself surrounded by girls who wanted to be my friend. So I shouted it from the rooftops, posted pictures, and celebrated my newfound acceptance into a sisterhood, without realizing that other people might still feel the way I did when I felt so alone.
 It's important to address our long-standing issues before we turn into the living embodiment of them.

Lesson 19

Playing mind games is for the chase. In a real relationship or friendship, you're shooting yourself in the foot if you don't tell the other person how you feel, and what could be done to fix it. No one is a mind reader. If someone really loves you, they want you to verbalize how you feel. This is real life, not chess.


Lesson 20

Learning the difference between lifelong friendships and situationships. Something about ""we're in our young twenties!"" hurls people together into groups that can feel like your chosen family.
 And maybe they will be for the rest of your life. Or maybe they'll just be your comrades for an important phase, but not forever. It's sad but sometimes when you grow, you outgrow relationships. You may leave behind friendships along the way, but you'll always keep the memories.

Lesson 21

Fashion is all about playful experimentation. If you don't look back at pictures of some of your old looks and cringe, you're doing it wrong. See: Bleachella.


Lesson 22

How to fight fair with the ones you love. Chances are you're not trying to hurt the person you love and they aren't trying to hurt you.
 If you can wind the tension of an argument down to a conversation about where the other person is coming from, there's a greater chance you can remove the shame of losing a fight for one of you and the ego boost of the one who ""won"" the fight. I know a couple who, in the thick of a fight, say ""Hey, same team."" Find a way to defuse the anger that can spiral out of control and make you lose sight of the good things you two have built. They don't give out awards for winning the most fights in your relationship. They just give out divorce papers.

Lesson 23

I learned that I have friends and fans in my life who don't care if I'm #canceled. They were there in the worst times and they're here now. The fans and their care for me, my well-being, and my music were the ones who pulled me through. The most emotional part of the Reputation Stadium Tour for me was knowing I was looking out at the faces of the people who helped me get back up. I'll never forget the ones who stuck around.


Lesson 24

I've had to learn how to handle serious illness in my family. Both of my parents have had cancer, and my mom is now fighting her battle with it again. It's taught me that there are real problems and then there's everything else. My mom's cancer is a real problem. I used to be so anxious about daily ups and downs. I give all of my worry, stress, and prayers to real problems now.


Lesson 25

I remember people asking me, ""What are you gonna write about if you ever get happy?"" There's a common misconception that artists have to be miserable in order to make good art, that art and suffering go hand in hand. I'm really grateful to have learned this isn't true. Finding happiness and inspiration at the same time has been really cool.

Lesson 26

I make countdowns for things I'm excited about.
 When I've gone through dark, low times, I've always found a tiny bit of relief and hope in getting a countdown app (they're free) and adding things I'm looking forward to. Even if they're not big holidays or anything, it's good to look toward the future. Sometimes we can get overwhelmed in the now, and it's good to get some perspective that life will always go on, to better things.

Lesson 27

I learned that disarming someone's petty bullying can be as simple as learning to laugh. In my experience, I've come to see that bullies want to be feared and taken seriously.
 A few years ago, someone started an online hate campaign by calling me a snake on the internet. The fact that so many people jumped on board with it led me to feeling lower than I've ever felt in my life, but I can't tell you how hard I had to keep from laughing every time my 63-foot inflatable cobra named Karyn appeared onstage in front of 60,000 screaming fans.
 It's the Stadium Tour equivalent of responding to a troll's hateful Instagram comment with ""lol."" It would be nice if we could get an apology from people who bully us, but maybe all I'll ever get is the satisfaction of knowing I could survive it, and thrive in spite of it.

Lesson 28

I'm finding my voice in terms of politics. I took a lot of time educating myself on the political system and the branches of government that are signing off on bills that affect our day-to-day life. I saw so many issues that put our most vulnerable citizens at risk, and felt like I had to speak up to try and help make a change. Only as someone approaching 30 did I feel informed enough to speak about it to my 114 million followers. Invoking racism and provoking fear through thinly veiled messaging is not what I want from our leaders, and I realized that it actually is my responsibility to use my influence against that disgusting rhetoric. I'm going to do more to help. We have a big race coming up next year.

Lesson 29

I learned that your hair can completely change texture. From birth, I had the curliest hair and now it is STRAIGHT. It's the straight hair I wished for every day in junior high. But just as I was coming to terms with loving my curls, they've left me. Please pray for their safe return.

Lesson 30

My mom always tells me that when I was a little kid, she never had to punish me for misbehaving because I would punish myself even worse. I'd lock myself in my room and couldn't forgive myself, as a five-year-old. I realized that I do the same thing now when I feel I've made a mistake, whether it's self-imposed exile or silencing myself and isolating. I've come to a realization that I need to be able to forgive myself for making the wrong choice, trusting the wrong person, or figuratively falling on my face in front of everyone. Step into the daylight and let it go."

By The Way Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I had to catch my breath
When I saw you there across the room, holding her hand

I'd have never guessed that starting over would look so good on you
But here I am
Still believing there might come a day
We'll pick up where we left off

[Chorus]
And by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say
By the way

[Verse 2]
I should've let you know all the ways you made me feel alive
I guess it's too late

So I'll just get my coat and make my way into this breezy night

Give you one last wave
Maybe you'll drop what you're doing and come over here to say
I'm looking good

[Chorus]
But by the way your eyes are dancing
I'd say the chances of that are getting slim
By the way my heart's still breaking
It's going to take it a while to love again
So many things that I forgot to say


[Outro]
By the way, you still look amazing
And I must've been crazy to let you get away
By the way, if you ever wondered
Still got the same old number, just in case
I still miss you and I still love you
By the way
By the way, oh"

Love Story (Taylor’s Version) [Elvira Remix] Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know


[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said


[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run

You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew

So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh



[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said


[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel

This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come""
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""


[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

[Verse 1]
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays

I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodiеs
Just to learn that you never carеd

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Verse 2]
I see the great escape
, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away


[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body

Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny
, I took the money

My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid


[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been"

I stay up too late
Got nothing in my brain
And that's what people say
That's what people say
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say
That's what people say

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind, saying it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, shake it off

Heart break is gonna break, break, break, break, break
And I think it's gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, Shake it off


[Verse 2]
I never miss a beat
I'm lighting up my feet
And that's what they don't see
That's what they don't see
I'm dancing on my own
I make the moves as I go
That's what they don't know
That's what they don't know

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music

And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

And I think it's gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Shake it off, Shake it off
Shake it off, Shake it off
Shake it off, Shake it off
Shake it off, Shake it off
Shake it off, Shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you been getting down
And out about the liars
And the dirty dirty cheats in the world
You could have been getting down to this sick beat
My ex boy brought his new girlfriend
She's like oh my god
But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the really good hair
Won't you get on over baby we could shake, shake, shake

[Chorus]
Yeah
Players gonna play, play, play, play, play
Haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off, Shake it off

Think it's gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

I take this magnetic force here to be my lover
And my heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
And all's well that ends well to end up with you
I swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus: Niall Horan & FLETCHER]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and ah
Take me out, and take me home
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Oh, darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"

[Verse 1]
Do you remember the day
I leaned up against your car
And it started rolling down the street?
You screamed and ran after it
And tried to open the door
And it ran over your foot
And I was too busy laughing on the ground to see

[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song

I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Verse 2]
Do you remember the time we watched Carrie
And you said it reminded you of me?
And I threw the remote at you
And you said ""my point exactly""

And later on that night, under the neon city lights
You paid a homeless guy to sing a song to me


[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along

[Bridge]
You call me lucky 'cause I lose everything
But I swear I'd be careful with it
If you gave me a ring


[Chorus]
It would take Brad Pitt to leave you
It takes five seconds to need you
When I'm mad at all the lovebirds
'Cause they don't know to play our song
I wish that pretty girls couldn't see you
I wish that all your roads would lead you right to me
'Cause that's where you belong
Until Brad Pitt comes along"

Taylor Swift’s Reputation (Reputation Tour Intro) Lyrics

Taylor Swift
Taylor Swift has declined to address that rumor-
Global superstar Taylor Swift (""and the winner is..."")
This is the first time photographers have caught T-Swift on film in six weeks
Taylor Swift
Taylor Swift
Grammys' youngest ever winner of Album of the Year, Fearless
Is there Bad Blood?

Taylor Swift is responsible for me being suspended

Taylor Swift is in hot water again
Taylor Swift is on top of the world, but has she done some sketchy things to get there?

Thirteen celebs who have issues with Taylor Swift

I felt like she was a little angry
Number thirteen

There she is leaving a restaurant
She holds too many grudges
Why did Taylor Swift-
You can see her feet at the very bottom, and can see her making her way into the car
I can understand trying to keep your relationship to yourself at the beginning, or needing to take some time to work on your craft

But come on!
And Taylor, voluntarily bringing attention to herself of her donations
What Swift did is not enough
Yeah, okay Tay, Whatever you say

I, I hate to say this, but I think Taylor Swift is learning a few lessons in life
All this drama is exhausting
Taylor Swift should focus on making the rest of reputation
Reputation
What it is-
Reputation
Taylor Swifts new romance is heating up
Reputation
And what has happened to the squad

Reputation
But at the same time, I think both-
Reputation
Taylor Swift takes the stand in court today

Taylor Swifts reputation
Reputation

So instead we'll talk about Taylor Swift's reputation

So instead we'll talk about Taylor Swifts reputation

I Need You Now Lyrics
[Verse 1]
""I need you now""
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called
""I need you now""
Words I said drowned out by the rain
Waiting there for you but you never came

[Pre-Chorus]
My world’s a little colder now
But I’m keeping warm somehow

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you, don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you?
I don’t need you, don’t need you now

[Verse 2]
""I need you now""
Words I heard you whisper to me
We were walking down a one-way street
You need me now
That’s what you’ve been telling my friends
But I’ve come too far to go back there again


[Pre-Chorus]
My heart, my mind, and numbers have changed
You might as well forget my name

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you, don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you?
I don’t need you, don’t need you now

[Bridge]
""I need you now""
Read letters that I wrote on the wall
And the message that I left when I called

[Chorus]
So here you are at my window
Guess nobody told you
I don’t need you, don’t need you
And I waited so frustrated
Who’s gonna hold you?
I don’t need you, don’t need you now

[Outro]
And I don’t look for your car
I don’t wonder where you are
I don’t dream about you 'cause I don’t need you now
I don’t dream about the way
That I never heard you say:
“I need you, I need you”
I don’t need you now
Don’t need you
Don’t need you now"

10 Dollars and a 6 Pack Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You were what I wanted, what I wanted
What I just couldn't have
You were country lovin', really something
For three months and a half

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Everybody said that you were bad news
But, baby, I was betting on you

[Chorus]
So, I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country servin' of payback
And now, I'm going to have to listen to my mother, ""I told you so""
You ain't even worth all that
Ten dollars and a six pack


[Verse 2]
I said, ""Let them say we're crazy""
You say, ""Let's go fishing"" a lot

The midnight moon was blazin', baby
I was gazin' into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
I caught you staring every other girl down

[Chorus]
So, I guess I owе my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country sеrvin' of payback
And now, I'm going to have to listen to my mother, ""I told you so""
You ain't even worth all that
Ten dollars and a six pack


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Can't believe the time you lost me
I can't believe what it cost me

[Chorus]
'Cause I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big old servin' of payback
I have to listen to my mother's ""I told you so's""
You ain't never been through that
'Cause you ain't worth all that
Ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that

My name's Gracie
I'll be five in May
Kind of scared cause
I've never been on a plane
My mama says that it'll be alright
Cause I'm going to see my daddy tonight
And she says that

[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

[Verse 2]
My name's Heather
Guess we're on the same flight
Don't mind Gracie
She could talk to you all night
She's finally well enough to travel
Doctor says she's in the clear
She's been in and out of hospital
Since the beginning of the year


[Chorus]
There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

[Verse 3]
James T. Johnson
That's her daddy's name
He's been overseas
It'll be a year today
He never talked about being scared over the phone
He just said me and Gracie will come and take him on

There's a whole a lot of good people in heaven
And I don't wanna get there too soon
And I know there's a God because I met him
And I see it when I'm looking at you
There ain't no accidents in what we do

Best Days of Your Life Lyrics
[Chorus 1]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Verse 1]
Ain't it a shame?
A shame that every time you hear my name
Brought up in a casual conversation
You can't think straight?
And ain't it sad
You can't forget about what we had?
Take a look at her and do you like what you see
Or do you wish it was me?

[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Verse 2]
And does she know
Know about the times you used to hold me
Wrapped me in your arms and how you told me
I'd be the only one?
I heard about
Yeah, someone told me once when you were out
She went a little crazy, ran her mouth about me
Ain't jealousy funny?


[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met to the very last night
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Verse 3]
Life with me was a fairytale love
I was head over heels 'til you threw away us
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Bridge]
I heard you're gonna get married, have a nice little family
Live out my dreams with someone new
But I've been told that a cheater is always a cheater
So I've got my pride and she's got you


[Chorus 2]
'Cause I'll be there in the back of your mind
From the day we met 'til you were making me cry
And it's just too bad you already had the best days
The best days of your life

[Outro]
Of your life, oh, oh yeah
You're gonna think of me
You're gonna think of me in your life
Oh, oh, yeah
It's a shame
It's a shame

How you laugh when you lie

Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last

Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't

So if you come in my way
Just don't

And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood


[Chorus: Should've Said No]
You should've said, ""No"", you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Bad blood!)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet

You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge: Bad Blood]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

Thirteen Blocks (Can’t Call It Love) Lyrics
In “Thirteen Blocks,” Taylor laments about a fading relationship. Interestingly, thirteen is her lucky number, so it’s ironic that she’s using it in regards to something that is going down in flames.
[Verse 1]
Stumble up the porch step
You sat down in the car
Only thirteen blocks across this town
To get to where you are
And that don’t offer me much time
To make up my mind
So I best be driving slow
On my way to letting go

[Verse 2]
These headlights they just wanna fade
Off into the night
But if they’re half as stubborn as me
They’ll just keep on shining bright
I ain’t ever been one to settle like
The dust does on the dash
Since the feeling ain’t strong
I’ll just move on
And leave this in my past

[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin' 'bout how I'll feel the day
I see you find somebody new
So I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it


[Verse 3]
Red light turns to green
Then back to red again

I wish there were some other travelers out here
To slow my travelling
Even though the wheel rolled on
Inside I still don’t know
Oh and it troubles me so, oh

[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin' 'bout how I'll feel the day
I see you found somebody new
And I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I might miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it

[Chorus]
Once you're gone I know your memory'll
Somehow get the best of me
So I question everything I do
Unsure of turning you away
Wonderin' 'bout how I'll feel the day
I see you find somebody new
So I’ve been holding on
Way too long
But not another minute
I'm gonna miss you bad but
Can’t call it love if you ain’t in it

Your car comes to a rest in the drive
You open up the door and I see you smile"

The enlivening country song “Lucky You” is considered the first of countless tracks Swift has written. The lyrics share a positive outlook on the life of a girl named Lucky, who lives without any worries. … Read More 
[Verse 1]
There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never

You could do better, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite

Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, ""Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Lucky you, lucky you""

[Verse 2]
She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies

Left to travels, lives they unravel
Mind over matter, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite

Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, ""Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you""


[Bridge]
Maybe she'll sing you do-do-do-do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey, she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you aren't so far away


[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite

Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, ""Lucky you, lucky you"""

The Making Of A Song - ‘Gorgeous’ Lyrics
First Version

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
And I ain't just talking about your face
But look at your face
Oh yeah
And I'm so curious
Your mind got me feeling some type of way
What can I say?
You're gorgeous
(Huh, huh, oh-huh)

Two Weeks Later

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
I tell 'em [?] so right

A Little Bit Later

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
'Cause you're cool, yeah
You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field getting way too strong
Is that cool? Yeah


Later That Same Day

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
(Huh, huh, oh-huh)
You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field
You know it ain't my fault
You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong
(Huh, huh, oh-huh)
And I've got a boyfriend he's older than us
I haven't seen him in a couple of months
[?] you now
Hey!

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
(Huh, huh, oh-huh)
And I'm so curious
What's it like making me feel this way?
Yeah, what can I say?
You're gorgeous
(Huh, huh, huh, huh, huh, oh)

Still Working


[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I've got a boyfriend he's older than us
I haven't seen him in a couple of months
I go through phases when it comes to love
I'm nothing that you want but I must say

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face -

I got a boyfriend he's older than us
I haven't seen him in a couple of months
You've gotta [?]

I got a boyfriend he's older than us
I haven't seen him in a couple of months
My reputation precedes both of us

I got a boyfriend he's older than us
I haven't seen him in a -

One Day Later

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I've got a boyfriend he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You so cool I can't -
(You're so cool, I hate you so much)
I've got a boyfriend he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, I hate you so much


[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face

Still At It

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I've got a boyfriend he's older than us
He's in the club doing, I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much
Hate you so much

[Chorus]
'Cause you're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
(Huh, huh, oh-huh)
And I'm so curious
What's -

Two Days Later

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment that I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence of your magnetic field being a little too strong

He's in the club doing, I don't know what
And you're so cool, it makes me hate you so much

[Part 1: Shadow]

Salt streams
, never wanted you to hate me

A beautiful magic love there

Call it what you want, yeah, call it what you want to

All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around

You can hear it in the silence

All those shadows almost killed your light
 (Lover
)
You should've said no
 (Mmm
)
Can you feel this magic in the air?
 (Ah-ah, ahh
)
C'mon, c'mon, don't leave me like this
 (Mmm
)
Took a deep breath in the mirror
 (Ah-ah, ahh
)
Sayin' ""It’s gonna be alright""

In the middle of the night in my dreams
 (Lover
, ah-ah, ahh
)
I think I've seen this film before
 (Mmm
)
As if you were a mythical thing
 (Ah-ah, ahh
)
If you never looked my way
I would've stayed on my knees

Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe

I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
 (Ah-ah-ah)
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
 (Mmm)
'Tis the damn season, write this down
 (Ahh-ahh)

And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering

Now I'm haunted
 (Ooh-ooh-ooh
)
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
 (Ah-ah-ah)

Baby
, you didn't even hear me out (Didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

All this time

I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off
 (Ah-ah, ahh
)
Keep your e-eyes open
 (Yeah)
Wildest dreams, ah-ah, ahh

I regret you all the time

So I'm leaving out the side door

I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in

I watched it begin again

You should've said no
 (Mmm
)
The more that you say, the less I know

I just wanna know you better now
 (Mmm)
I think I've seen this film before

How could you do this babe?



[Part 2: Ultraviolet]

And I don't know how it gets better than this

When I was drowning that's when I was
—
Screaming long live

I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
 (Hey)

It'll leave you breathless

'Cause baby, now we got bad blood

Tell me why

That's when, when I wake up in the morning
 (Hi)

Say that we'll be together

We are never ever, ever, getting back together

Gone was any trace of you I think I can
 finally win

I've never been anywhere cold as you

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I'd marry you with paper rings

Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts

Bye-bye,
 I forgot that you existed

The autumn chill that wakes me up

I still got love for you
 (It's me)

You loved the amber sky so much
, wanna be with you
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""

I know how to act like I'm fine

And that's the way I loved you
 (It's me)
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

(Hey) I don't know about you

Or it's gonna go down in flames
 (Ooh
)
Everything will be alright if

If the high was worth the pain

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me

Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy

We just keep dancing like we're (Oh)

Fifteen and somebody tells you they love you

Yeah, twenty-two, ooh-ooh

This is why we can't have nice

All you had to do was (Stay)

It's cool
, karma is a relaxing thought

As far as I'm concerned you're just another picture to burn

I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
 (Ah)
If I can't relate to you (Yeah) anymore then who am I related to
 (Mmm-mm, mm-mm)
Nothing but nothing but well wishes for ya (Mmm-mm, mm-mm) would do

It was maroon



[Part 3: Cherry]

I didn't know what I would find
Just the first time ever hanging out with you
You brush past me in the hallway and—
You say, ""We'll never make my parents' mistakes""
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
And I could wait patiently
But now I'm standing here hoping this gets to you
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
I wish I could fly

Welcome to New York

And they said, ""Speak now""

Come feel this magic I've been feeling—
It's been waiting for you, welcome to new york, welcome to new york
Like we were in Paris
And that's how it works, that's how you get the girl
Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly (Oh-oh)
I'd write this in the sky
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
You should've been here
I won't go away
Horrified looks from everyone in the room but I'm only looking at you
 (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)
Drop everything now
I watched Superman fly away
Been here all along so why can't you see
Sparks fly
I miss you like it was the very first night


[Part 4: Rust]

(Grahh)
 Look what you just made me do, look what you just made me do
She's still 23, inside her fantasy (Grahh)
I think he knows his footprints on the sidewalk
Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep
C'mon baby, with me, we're gonna fly away
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Never gonna love again
And you wanna scream, ""Combat""
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room? (In a crowded room)
No, I don't like you (Hey)
I spy with my little tired eye, tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Rain, he wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain (Mmm-mmm)
He wanted it comfortable I wanted that pain (Hey)
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams (Hey)
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(What is happening to me?)
(I-I-I, I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I, I-I-I) I'm ready to fly
I don't think so
Oh, Lord, save me my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (Huh, huh, huh)
You got my heart—
I wish you'd come back, wish I never hung up the phone like I did I
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart (Oh, no), body and soul
(Huh, huh, huh, ha-huh)
It turned into something bigger (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
Can I ask you a question?
I wish you were right here, right now
It's all good, I wish you would (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Look what you just made me do, look what you just made me do

[Part 5: Sapphire]

(One, two, three)
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes

And you didn't see me here

I'd be smart to walk away,
 today
When I'm nothing new

Checkmate, I couldn't lose

We were both young when I first saw you

Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little (Oh, oh)

When you are young they assume you know nothing

You're on your own kid, you always have been

We are alone with our changing minds
There's a key on a chain, there's a picture in a frame
Another name goes up in lights
Begging you, please don't go
So If I see you again
This is me trying
We still worship this love (Oh-oh, oh)
What did you think I'd say to that
You made us proud, you made us proud (Oh-oh, oh)
When Emma falls in love she paces the floor (Oh-oh, oh)
Closes the blinds and locks the door (Oh-oh, oh)

Better than revenge
And you know it's never simple never easy (Oh-oh, oh)
I don't wanna go there anymore (Oh-oh, oh, I get sad)
I remember every look upon your face
I'll catch you, I'll catch you (Oh-oh, oh)
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. ""Too late""
So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
Who you are is not where you been
But the story of us might be ending soon
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand (Ohhh, ohhhh)
And I hope you know that
Come back, come back
'Cause I can't live without, baby
Come back, be here
Come here dressed in black now, so, so, so it goes
The joker and the queen
Why you gotta be so mean?
I'll hold you as the water rushes in
The water's high, you're jumping into it
If I'm not dancing with you
But I stayed anyway

[Part 6: Amber]

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place
I wanna be your endgame, fatefully
I wanna be your first string
Sometimes to run is the brave thing
I used to think I'll meet somebody just like our last—
The worst thing that I ever did (He did it) is what I did to you
We were in the backseat, drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
Now I just sit in the dark
I'll brighten up the sky
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
And I've got that red lip, classic thing that you like
Wind in my hair, I was there
In the car, I keep singing, don't know why I do
I promise that nobody’s gonna love you like me
I bet you think about me, baby
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
They'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down 'cause I
Remember when we hit the brakes too soon
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause us traitors never win
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
Just take me home
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
This is the last time I let you in my door
It's a goddamned blaze in the dark and you started it
I hope I never lose you
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
You're losing me
Keep your helmet
And I was catching my breath (Oh)
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Just know that
All those time that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you

(Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh)
Not without my muse
I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me

[Part 7: Aurora]

Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneaking out late tapping on your window
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
Just take me home
And I'm so furious (Yeah) at you for making me feel this way
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me (Me-he-he)
Fighting in only your army
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say (Style)
Isn't it, isn’t it, isn't it?
So I think that it's best if we both stay
And I wouldn't marry me either
Snakes and stone never broke my bones so
People throw rocks at things that shine
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Our song is the way he laughs
This is a big world
This love is ours
'Cause there we again
'Cause we never go out of style
Isn't it, isn't it, isn't it?
Oh-oh, oh-oh, you need to calm down
Will it patch your broken wings?
I had a feeling so peculiar
You're choosing me

Superstar, I remember all too well
You won't remember all my champagne problems
Delicate
And goodbye's so much harder
Dear reader
I can't find a pulse, my heart won't start anymore
I tell you my problems, you tell me the truth
I'll tell you the truth but never goodbye"

I Hate It Here (The Lakes - Live from Cardiff) Lyrics
[Part I: I Hate It Here]

[Verse]
Quick, quick
Tell me something awful
Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
Tell me all your secrets
All you'll ever be is
My eternal consolation prize
You see I was a debutant in another life but
Now I seem to be scared to go outside
If comfort is a construct
I don't believe in good luck
Now that I know what's what

[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to
Secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to
The only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small town fears
I'm there most of the year
Cause I hate it here
I hate it here


[Part II: the lakes]

[Verse]
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones

[Chorus]
Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Part III: I Hate It Here]

[Bridge]
I'm lonely but I'm good
I'm bitter but I swear I'm fine
I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on
Purpose
This place made me feel worthless
Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me
And in my fantasies I rise above it
And way up there, I actually love it

[Part IV: the lakes]


[Bridge]
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

[Chorus]
Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
'Cause I don't belong, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Spoken Interruption]


[Part V: I Hate It Here / the lakes]

[Chorus]
I hate it here so I will go to
Secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to
The only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small town fears
I hate it here so I will go to
Lunar valleys in my mind
When they found a better planet
Only the gentle survived
I dreamed about it in the dark
The night I felt that I might die
No mid-sized city hopes and small town fears
I'm here most of the year
Cause I hate it here


[Outro]
So, take me to the lakes
I hate it here, so take me to the lakes
Take me to the lakes
Where all of the poets went to die, I don't belong
My beloved neither to you
Those Windermere peaks, look like a perfect place to cry
So, I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you"

Beautiful Ghosts (Victoria’s Song) Lyrics
[Verse]
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Bridge]
And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free

[Chorus]
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
The memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts"

[Verse 1]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know

Where the tree tops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow

With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

[Verse 3]
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know

So may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white

Thinkin’ ’Bout You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinkin' 'bout you
Your face jumped right in my way
As things lately do
Oh baby can't you see
The thought of you makes a mess of me
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinkin' 'bout you

[Chorus]
And Now I
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'bout you

Oh, ah

[Verse 2]
I get lost when I drive around town
Thinkin' 'bout your smile
Always endin' up
Your side of town
And I don't know why
Must be somethin' under this hood
Nobody's strong like you
Walked into a chair leg
As I was thinkin' 'bout you


[Chorus]
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'bout you

[Verse 3]
Your eyes are the color of
The great big sea
The one I go swimmin' in
Every time you look at me

[Chorus]
Can't walk straight
Can't talk straight
Can't think about anything but the way
It should be
It could be
And till you come 'round again I'll be
Doin' what I usually do
Thinkin' 'bout you

[Verse 1]
Flamingo pink, Sunrise Boulevard
Clink, clink, being this young is art
Aquamarine, moonlit swimmin' pool
What if all I need is you?

[Pre-Chorus]
Got love-struck, went straight to my head
Got lovesick all over my bed
Love to think you'll never forget
Handprints in wet cement
Adorned with smoke on my clothes
Lovelorn and nobody knows
Love thorns all over this rose
I'll pay the price, you won't


[Chorus]
But if I'm all dressed up
They might as well be lookin' at us
And if they call me a slut

You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love


[Verse 2]
Send the code, he's waitin' there
The sticks and stones they throw froze mid-air
Everyone wants him, that was my crime
The wrong place at the right time
And I break down, then he's pullin' me in
In a world of boys, he's a gentleman


[Pre-Chorus]
Got love-struck, went straight to my head (Straight to my head)
Got lovesick all over my bed (Over my bed)
Love to think you'll never forget
We'll pay the price, I guess

[Chorus]
But if I'm all dressed up (If I'm all dressed up)
They might as well be lookin' at us (Lookin' at us)
And if they call me a slut (If they call me a slut)

You know it might be worth it for once (Worth it for once)
And if I'm gonna be drunk
I might as well be drunk in love


[Bridge]
Half asleep
Takin' your time in the tangerine
Neon light, this is luxury
You're not sayin' you're in love with me
But you're goin' to
Half awake
Takin' your chance, it's a big mistake
I said, ""It might blow up in your pretty face""
I'm not sayin', ""Do it anyway"" (Do it anyway)
But you're going to


[Outro]
(Up)
And if they call me a (Slut)

You know it might be worth it for once
And if I'm gonna be (Drunk)
I might as well be drunk in love"

Sometimes I wonder how it's going to feel
Will my first love be true and real?
Will I be ready when my heart starts to fall?
What will I do when my love comes to call?
And my daddy tells me that I light up his world
Everyday he says, darling you're my best girl
He tried to teach me from the very start
The meaning of love so nobody breaks my heart


[Chorus]
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?

Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for love

[Verse 2]
I know I'm not a little girl anymore
Cause I'm feeling things I've never felt before
Sweet sensations and anticipations
Calling commotion to my emotions
And I hear the words my daddy said to me
He said be true 2 yourself & keep your spirit free
And love will find you one way or another
Be good to yourself and be good to each other


[Chorus]

[Verse 3]
It's a run around the world
And it's moving so fast
Though I want to find
A love that's going to last
A love so strong
That I can withstand
The weight of the world
In the palm of its hand

[Chorus]
Will my love come in a bowl of fire?
Will it be filled with hope and desire?
Will my love come in a pouring rain?
Am I ready for the joy, am I ready for the pain
Am I ready for the boy, am I ready for this game

Am I ready for the kiss, am I ready for the stars
Am I ready for the bliss, am I ready for love"

Your Face Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I heard a song tonight on the radio
Another girl sings about a boy
Just sees his face in every space in every room

And I know that if I turn around you won't be there
If I close my eyes will you be there?

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared of
What love
Gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face


[Verse 2]
I've got a picture of you in my bedroom
And I hope it never falls
And I hope I never lose that feeling
I used to get when you would call
And now I wonder to myself
Who were you and where are you?
Were you ever here at all?



[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared of
What love
Gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face


[Verse 3]
That girl in the song had it so good
I wish I could close my eyes and see you
I wish the sky had your face
And the oceans had your eyes
And the sunset had your lips

And I had you

[Chorus]
I don't want to lose your face
I don't want to wake one day
And not remember what time erased
And I don't want to turn around
Because I’m not scared of
What love
Gave me and took away
And I don't want to lose your face



[Outro]
Oh no no
I don't want to lose your face
I don't want to turn around
Oh-oh lose your face, yeah
I don't want to lose your face
I don't want to lose your face"

Cruel Summer (Live from TS | The Eras Tour) Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh, hi

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killin' me slow, out the window
I'm always waitin' for you to be waitin' below
Devils roll their dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feelin' I've got

And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruеl summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of thе vending machine
I'm not dyin' (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)


[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll their dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feelin' I've got

And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Break]
Alright, Los Angeles, we have arrived
At the very first bridge of the evening
Now, I have a question
Does anyone here know the lyrics to this bridge?
Prove it

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil


[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feelin' I've got

And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true

And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Cruel summer
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
It's a cruel summer
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
It's a cruel summer"

Honey Baby Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
I think of you every single evening
As I lay awake at night
I try to think; try to walk away with you
But you pull me in and I say

[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
'Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby
Oh

[Verse 2]
Flying high, I can see his smiling
As we walk down by the drives
Take my hand, take my breath away
'Cause you make me feel like flying!

[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine!
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
'Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby


[Bridge]
Oh, you are everything I'll never need
Oh, you are everything I wanna be
Drive me crazy, have me baby
All I really wanna say is

[Chorus]
Honey baby don't do nothing crazy
When I say that everything will be fine
Oh, honey baby, oh
How can you blame me
When I say I wanna make you mine?
'Cause everybody else in the world is driving me crazy
Except you, honey baby

Oh
Except you, honey baby"

Matches Lyrics
I shined your shoes
I poured the wine
I gave you all of my time


I patched your dents
Smiled at your friends
Which apparently is a crime

I gave you space
You took my place
And gave it to her


But life's too long
To waste it all loving a liar

And when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down


I keyed her car
Got my guitar
And wrote this damn song

Look what you've found
She's been around
I hear the lines long


And don't you tell me
To be nice
I'm not a nice girl

She died from complications
Of the things you told her

So when love hands me matches now
I'm gonna burn it down


Ain't it funny
You said honey
You meant sitting duck

Well I say, cheater, liar, truck on fire, loser, leaver, deceiver

Just a few I've thought of

And when love hands me matches now
'Gonna burn it down
I'm gonna burn it down
Oh yeah
Gonna burn it, burn it, burn it down


Matches, now"

Picture to Burn (Live From SoHo) Lyrics
[Intro]
This one's called ""Picture to Burn""
One, two, three

[Verse 1]
Well, state the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
And by the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
Well, there's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn
Thank you so much!
Thank you!"

The Bolter (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
By all accounts, she almost drowned
When she was six in frigid water
And I can confirm she made
A curious child, ever reviled
By everyone except her own father
With a quite bewitching face
Splendidly selfish, charmingly helpless
Excellent fun 'til you get to know her
Then she runs like it’s a race
Behind her back, her best mates laughed
And they nicknamed her ""The Bolter""

[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then she'll call him a bore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing

[Post-Chorus]
All her many lives
Flashed before her eyes
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive


[Verse 2]
He was a cad, wanted her bad
Just like any good trophy hunter
And she liked the way it tastes
Taming a bear, making him care
Watching him jump then pulling him under
And at first blush, this is fate
When it’s all roses, portrait poses
Central Park Lake in tiny rowboats
What a charming Saturday
That's when she sees the littlest leaks
Down in the floorboards
And she just knows she must bolt

[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evening
Ended with the slam of a door
Then she'll call him a bore
Wish he wouldn't be sore
But as she was leaving
It felt like breathing

[Post-Chorus]
All her many lives
Flashed before her eyes (Ah-ah-ah)
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive


[Bridge]
She's been many places with
Men of many faces
First, they're off to the races
And she's laughing, drawin' aces
But none of it is changin’
That the chariot is waitin’
Hearts are hers for the breakin'
There’s escape in escaping

[Chorus]
Started with a kiss
""Oh, we must stop meeting like this""
But it always ends up with a town car speeding
Out the drive one evenin'
Ended with the slam of a door
But she's got the best stories
You can be sure
That as she was leaving
It felt like freedom

[Post-Chorus]
All her many lives
Flashed before her eyes (And she realized)
It feels like the time
She fell through the ice
Then came out alive"

my tears ricochet (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace

And you're the hero flying around, saving face

And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?

Cursing my name, wishin' I stayed

Look at how my tears ricochet


[Verse 2]
We gather stones, nevеr knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, somе to make a diamond ring

You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene

You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishin' I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
When I'm screaming at the sky

And when you can't sleep at night
You hear my stolen lullabies

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishin' I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossin' out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishin' I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Outro]
Yeah, look at how my tears ricochet
Look at all of my tears
Turnin' into your tears
Look at how my tears ricochet"

Firefly Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Someone struck a match against the night
All I could see was you and I
I was captivated
A perfect little dream inside my head
And then reality crept in, and erased it

[Pre-Chorus]
For a while I thought that I could hold you
But you were just a temporary high

[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly
Firefly

[Verse 2]
Something so beautiful and free
Was as never meant to be caged in
I thought I had you in my hand
I tried to catch you, but I can't
Chase the wind

[Pre-Chorus]
And just as I reach out to touch you
I remind myself you were meant to fly


[Chorus]
Firefly you drew me to you
Your beauty shines and lights up the sky
And you don't know it, do you?
I wish I could keep you firefly

I like to think I'd be all that you wanted
Not even that is enough

Being with My Baby Lyrics
“Being With My Baby” is one of Taylor Swift’s unreleased songs about spending time with a lover on summer nights. It was later recorded by Shea Fisher, who released her version in 2009.
[Verse 1]
All is quiet in the world tonight
Counting stars and fireflies
And summer sings a lullaby
With me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
We pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby

[Pre-Chorus]
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Verse 2]
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
And take a picture with my mind
Of me and my baby

The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
That back road was a better way
For me and my baby



[Pre-Chorus]
The closer that we get
I know I can't leave yet

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Bridge]
Look at what we've found
So he turns that car around

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, and be with my baby
Ooh, yeah
Keeping it young and crazy

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don’t touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity’s too much
And I’ll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I’d be smart to walk away
But you’re quicksand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I, like it

[Verse 2]

I can’t decide if it’s a choice
Getting swept away

I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay

And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you’re friction

This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I, like it

Two headlights shine through the sleepless night

This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous

And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

Midnight, you come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive, could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you (Heard from you)

And I should just tell you to leave 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads but I
Watch it go round and round each time

[Spoken]
Dallas, will you, please, make some noise for my incredible band?

[Verse 2: Love Story]
We were both young when I first saw you
Close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello"", little did I know?

[Pre-Chorus 2: Love Story]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, please, don't go
And I said

[Chorus 2: Love Story]
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all that's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

[Bridge 1: Love Story]
Oh, oh
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, I said


[Breakdown: Love Story]
""Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said

[Chorus 3: Love Story]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

[Bridge 2: You Belong With Me]
Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're about to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me about your dreams
I think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus 4: You Belong With Me]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along so why can't you see?
You belong with me, yeah
Let me see you jump!
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me


[Outro: You Belong With Me]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"

The Life of a Showgirl [Liner Notes] Lyrics
And Baby, That's Show Business For You

You wake up branded with the lines of pillow creases
Thunderbolted tree roots across your cheek
In turn, last night's mascara stains the ivory hotel pillowcase
Each one leaving their mark on the other
Looks like you're even
You say ""good morning"" to them when you walk in and they don't correct you
As they spray vodka on the armpits of the dancer's costumes
We learn these tricks along the way
The flesh toned bandage wrap
Covered by skin colored fishnets
Because you will cover the wound, no matter how deep it is
No one ever knew
And baby, that's show business for you

Sweat And Vanilla Perfume

Coffee stretch
Piano keys
Vocal warm ups in a locker room shower
Eyelash glue
A photo of him on the mirror
Sweat and vanilla perfume
The cracking of joints and the distant beat of a drum
The curtain call
The menotous thrill of it all
Plan it out so it doesn't look planned
Ten different backup plans
If your red bottomed heel breaks
You will keep strutting
Balancing on the walls of your blistered feet
Know your exits
Shoulders back
Eyes up
Hit your marks
Your winks
Sparks
Tell them a story like it's an intimate dinner party
The looks on their wondrous faces
Their expressions like mood rings
Isn't it all so majestic?
Of course it is
It's a lot of other things too


The Crowd Is Your King

Remember this city?
You've been here before in another life
On another tour
Remember her?
She's got a mortgage now
Straight teeth where there'd been metal brackets
Standing with her eight year old daughter
You mouth ""I know you""
In the millisecond gap in your choreography
To you, she will look exactly the same age as when you first saw her
She will always be fourteen and a half
Remember
Lock right back into the footwork
Any missed step is a misstep
You must remember everything
But mostly this: the crowd is your king who has ruled over you for centuries
Benevolently for the most part

The Shiny Bug

Perhaps someday they will despise you again
Perhaps it is not a matter of ""if,"" but ""when?""
They'll re-assess your merits and then take a magnifying glass to the shiny bug
Deflate all the heroes they had decided she was
And maybe they'll do it just because
But you live by a strict code
Never believe your own mythology
Never type your name into the search bar
Let the wolves howl all they want
So you keep yourself too busy to ever learn what's-their-name's name


The Tiny Bubbles In Champagne

He ran to his car from work to catch the flight
Missed the first act but somehow it's better this way
It's just right because you get to watch him make his way through the masses
Parting the crowd like some neon Moses in a sequin sea
He is a magnet and a trampoline
The tiny bubbles in champagne
Haphazard but precise, he crash-landed next to you
Reckless, but never with your heart
If he's in, you are too
You've begun to feel that
Every song before was just a prayer
A wish list
He is not what you've been waiting for
He is more
Why you held out
Why you left
And nothing aches suddenly
He has that effect

The Life of a Showgirl (It's Beautiful, It's Rapturous, It's Frightening)

Tonight all these lives converge here
The mosaics of laughter and cocktails of tears
Where fraternal souls sing identical things
And it's beautiful, it's rapturous, it is frightening
It's worth everything it has cost you
And even at your darkest or drunkest
You wouldn't say any different
Would you?
You would choose all of it again
No matter how the story ends
With the ugliest boos or the loveliest boquet
They say that love is a choice you make every single day
And that is how you love the life of a showgirl"

Her Lyrics
“Her” seems to be about the same situation as 2006’s “Teardrops on My Guitar” and Swift’s unreleased track “Permanent Marker.” Much like on the other unreleased track “Angelina,” Swift describes the “other… Read More 
[Verse 1]
She's real pretty if you’re into that brunette
Looks good without any makeup on
Green eyes kind of thing
Uh huh
She's spontaneous, she ain't afraid of anything
She’s not the jealous type
She's the type you give a diamond ring

[Pre-Chorus]
And I came along, just after she walked out
Picking up the pieces 'til I've figured out

[Chorus]
There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not

And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it’s like you cross it every time

When you can’t stop thinking about her

[Verse 2]
She came from a really small town
She liked to watch football with you
Well, I'd learn football too, if you wanted me to
Uh huh
She’s really good with babies, she'd be a great mother
She said I should really meet her sometime
Uh huh


[Pre-Chorus]
It's getting old, I wonder if you've seen
The favorite conversation’s killing me

[Chorus]
There's a girl that you want
She's everything that I am not
And you can't stop thinking about her
There's a thin little line
And it's like you cross it every time
When you can't stop thinking about her

[Bridge]
Don't you know I was a 4.0 in school?"

A Look Behind the Curtain Lyrics
[Spoken]
The Life of A Showgirl, the idea of doing that was just, it was that this tour bled into everything I was doing and I was on this tour when I was making this record and I'd be doing three shows and then fly to Sweden and record for three days, take one day off, do three more shows. And that was like the thing that energized me in the second half of that tour because the tour had been going on so long, it was so physically exhaustive, I needed something to keep my mind sparking, like that was actually what made me so, like, it fueled me for the for the europеan leg of the tour, was, was getting donе with a show hopping on a plane and going and writing new songs and I think that, I think that one of the sort of ideas I had going into this was that I was winding down this tour and about ready to wrap up this tour, that was the proudest thing I'd ever done, I've never been more proud of of anything than I am the Eras Tour and I just thought, ""I want to make an album that I'm that proud of,"" and that's what, um, was the catalyst for this record and calling up Max and saying, ""Do you guys want to do this? Like I'll come to you, I'll make this easy,"" um, and I think that the The Life of A Showgirl as a concept has to do with the the fact that I was like, I just kind of realized I've been doing this for twenty years and I love it so much that it doesn't phase me how hard it can be at times. I think that the whole thing of being someone who puts yourself out there and puts yourself up there on a stage for people to like throw tomatoes at or cheer for is maybe something more people can relate to now that everybody has feedback all the time like even like people in like junior high feel like they got canceled because two people didn't like their outfit. We are all on this sort of pedestal now because of social media, anybody who chooses to engage with that, which is most people. I think a lot of people are feeling more like there's a performative side to their life that they have to. They have to balance, manage, figure out the ways around those complicated feelings. And ultimately I'm really proud of doing what we did on the Eras Tour. It was really challenging and really fulfilling and lots of things all at once. And I just wanted to give people a look behind the curtain and show them what was going on creatively in my mind at the time"

Blank_Space Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sin
Saw you there, and I thought
'Oh my god, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play'
Oh no

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad girls good for a weekend

[Chorus 1]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
You gotta love the players
And you love the game


[Chorus 2]
Cos we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the queen, baby, I'm your king
Find out what you want
Be that guy for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh no

[Verse 4]
You're screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turns
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
'Oh my god, who is he?'
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
Cos darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream



[Chorus 3]
So it's gonna be forever (Girls only want love if it's torture)
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over (Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya)
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers (Girls only want love if it's torture)
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cos you know I love the players (Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya)
And you love the game

[Chorus 4]
Cos we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
I've got a blank space, baby
I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"

Tell Me Lyrics
This song is one of the famous unreleased by Taylor Swift, always confused with Tell me Why, song from the second album of this artist.
[Verse 1]
It was something like a perfect start to this love yesterday
But now who are you?
I thought I knew
Your eyes happen now to look right through me
It’s like you forgot the words you whispered to me
They weren't true
It's like it wasn't you

[Chorus]
Could you tell me what did I do?
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
Tell me

[Verse 2]
Take time to realize
I know that people change their minds
But that was something I wished you would say to my face
But you ran away


[Chorus]
Could you tell me what did I do?
Because it can't be we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
Tell me


[Bridge]
If I had a reason or a simple goodbye
Baby, even a lie
Yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
Tell me what did I do
'Cause, baby, suddenly we're already through
Did you sell me out for a fool after you held me?
Was that just what you do?
What did you need from me?
And tell me

[Outro]
And tell me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-yeah
And tell me
Tell me"

In Summation [Poem] Lyrics
At this hearing
I stand before my fellow members of the Tortured Poets Department
With a summary of my findings
A debrief, a detailed rewinding
For the purpose of warning
For the sake of reminding

As you might all unfortunately recall
I had been struck with a case of a restricted
humanity

Which explains my plea here today of
temporary insanity


You see, the pendulum swings
Oh, the chaos it brings
Leads the caged beast to do the most curious
things


Lovers spend years dеnying what's ill fated

Resentmеnt rotting away galaxies we
created

Stars placed and glued meticulously by hand
next to the ceiling fan

Tried wishing on comets.
Tried dimming the shine.
Tried to orbit his planet.

Some stars never align.



And in one conversation, I tore down the
whole sky.

Spring sprung forth with dazzling freedom hues
Then a crash from the skylight bursting through
Something old, someone hallowed, who told
me he could be brand new

And so I was out of the oven
And into the microwave

Out of the slammer and into a tidal wave

How gallant to save the empress from her
gilded tower
Swinging a sword he could barely lift

But loneliness struck at that fateful hour
Low hanging fruit on his wine stained lips

He never even scratched the surface of me
None of them did.

""In summation, it was not a love affair!""
I screamed while bringing my fists to my
coffee ringed desk
It was a mutual manic phase.
It was self-harm.
It was house and then cardiac arrest.



A smirk creeps onto this poet's face
Because it's the worst men that I write best.

And so I enter into evidence
My tarnished coat of arms
My muses, acquired like bruises
My talismans and charms
The tick, tick, tick of love bombs
My veins of pitch black ink

All's fair in love and poetry
Sincerely, The Chairman of The Tortured
Poets Department"

Baby Lyrics
Taylor brought her then-friend Justin Bieber onstage at her Speak Now Tour to sing his viral hit “Baby.”
[Intro: Justin Bieber]
Oh whoa
Oh whoa
Oh whoa


[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]
You know you love me, I know you care
Just shout whenever and I’ll be there
You are my love, you are my heart
And we will never, ever, ever be apart
Are we an item? Girl, quit playing
We’re just friends, what are you saying?
Said ""There’s another,"" and looked right in my eyes
My first love broke my heart for the first time, and I was like


[Chorus: Justin Bieber + Taylor Swift]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift + Justin Bieber]
Oh, for you I would have done whatever
And I just can’t believe we ain't together
And I wanna play it cool, but I'm losing you
I'll buy you anything, I'll buy you any ring
And I'm in pieces, baby, fix me
And just shake me 'til you wake me from this bad dream
I'm going down, down, down, down
And I just can’t believe my first love won’t be around, and I'm like



[Chorus: Taylor Swift + Justin Bieber]
Baby, baby, baby oh
Like baby, baby, baby no
Like baby, baby, baby no oh
Thought you’d always be mine, mine

My Cure Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I know we've got a lot to say
Between now and forever
But I'd be a game if you would play
And my dear you get better

All throughout the day
You smile and walk away
All I can think to do
Is follow you


[Chorus]
If you leave I'll be crawling back for more
If you need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you'd be my cure

[Verse 2]
Wherever you think I am tonight
Just know we're miles from a heartbreak
Because in the blink of a pretty brown eye
I'll be right where you are baby

Sometime along the way you take my breath away
Distracted by he view
I fall right into you



[Chorus]
And if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'll be standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you would be my cure

[Verse 3]
They say I need to see all the people out there waiting
But you take one look at me
And I know the mistake I'd be making

[Chorus]
Becasue if you ever leave I'll be crawling back for more
And if you ever need love I'm standing at your door
I'll be sick inside if baby you be my cure

I know we've got a lot to say between now and forever"

1989 Interview with Paul McGuire Lyrics
Taylor took part in an interview with CMT’s Paul McGuire that was televised on the day 1989 came out.
Paul: There's no big fancy introduction, I don't think we really need one. We just start talking.

Taylor: I mean, yeah, we could do that.

We could do that, right?

Yeah. I mean, did you have a fancy introduction planned?

No?

Did you have a song prepared?

Do we really, well, funny you should mention - no, no song. No song prepared, that's not gonna -

Not at all? And I came all the way to Canada.

Focusing on the year 1989, it was a great year. Do you know what the Best Picture that year was?

I do not.

The movie that won Best Picture in 1989: Rain Man.

Amazing!

Good movie, right?


Fantastic.

Good movie. The Album of the Year, do you know the [?] that won a Grammy? It's the first time that this has happened, really, to you?

Yeah.

In an interview about an album called 1989?

Well, I just figured you'd just want to show off your knowledge.

Well, it's the internet, it's not really showing off.

Okay.

George Michael's Faith!

Amazing!

Album of the Year.

This is actually educational.

It's pretty good, right? But I was happy that it wasn't, like, there weren't too sketchy things. Those were really good things that stand up. Rain Man is still great to watch, Faith is still a fantastic album.

""Like a Prayer"" by Madonna came out in 1989, one of the most influential pop songs and music videos of all time.



You were born.

I was in 1989 for two weeks.

Yeah, that's okay. That's okay.

But it still happened in that year.

It happened in 1989. You've only released a studio album four times previous to this, so this is something that doesn't happen to you all that often. So, the title of it -

It's really important.

The theme of it is really important, right? When was the moment you decided it was gonna be 1989?

Actually, no one... this is why I like talking to you, because no one has ever come at it from this angle and actually asked me that specific question. It's actually a really interesting moment. I remember exactly when I decided that I was gonna call it 1989. It was the night of the Grammys this year.
 After the Grammys I didn't go to any afterparties or anything, I kind of wanted to go home and eat In-N-Out Burger with my friends. I remember going home and playing a lot of the new music I had recorded for some of my backup singers and one of my best friends. We were all sitting in the kitchen and I was playing them all this music, and they were just saying, ‘you know, this is very eighties. It’s very clear to us that this is so eighties.’ We were just talking and talking about how it’s kind of a rebirth in a new genre, how that’s a big bold step, how, kind of, starting a part of your career over. When they left that night, I just had this very clear moment of, ‘it’s gotta be called 1989. It's gotta be called that. We're talking about creative rebirth, my birth year, the album is eighties-influenced.' I didn't know I was doing that but I was doing that.

You didn't know you were doing that?

I didn't mean to do it, I just was doing it. And so, then, after that, I really was able to focus on the, kind of, eighties sonic concept. And then it really came together as a very sonically cohesive project.

Were you still writing songs in the traditional way, with a guitar?

Yes and no, I mean, some of them I wrote on piano, some of them I wrote on guitar. Some of them I would think of some synth line in my head and sing it into my phone and send it to my co-writers and say, ‘do you think this would sound cool?’


Like, without words, just singing the, kind of, synth line?


Yeah! Or singing a drum beat over top of it, and I would send it to them and I'd go, ‘I don’t have the right keyboard to make this sound in my house. I just have a piano and a guitar, but let me play it for you on piano and let you know what I think the bassline should be, and we can start there.’ Or it would be a first line of a first verse, or it would be, sort of, an image that I wanted to create a feeling around. We would just start with this image I had, or a story. It was a lot different than making any of my other albums.

It was?

Yeah.

Biggest difference was what?

The biggest difference was that I didn't have any, I didn't have any boundaries around me production-wise. You know, one of my favorite things about country music is that it taught me how to tell stories. Coming up in the Nashville songwriting community was the greatest thing that could've ever happened to me because it taught me how to weave a story together with very, um, very detailed, personal details but also some, kind of, like, poetic, purple imagery. I love, kind of, I love how it all came about with my career, but at this point, it felt like I wanted to go and run in a direction that I had never run in before, which was, ""I wanna be able to use whatever instruments I want, whatever drum sounds I want, whatever vocal stylings I want. I want to build and layer things, and I don't want someone to say, 'well, this isn't country.'"" You know? And for me to be trying to prove that it was. So the reason this felt like a much more free experience was because I was able to write songs without the worry people would say it wasn't in the genre it was supposed to be in. So in labelling it pop and just calling it what it was, you know, when you make a pop album nobody's gonna look at it and say, ""well, that's not pop."" So I didn't have any restraints on me.

Jason Aldean recently said something about how you're not gonna hear him writing a song about being a Wall Street stock broker because he doesn't even know where Wall Street's at, and that was the -

He's gotta know where that is.

I think he-

It's in New York.

That's where he keeps his money.

He's gotta know. He knows where it's at.

I think he was trying to say, just why -

I get what he's trying to say, though. Sorry, I was just, like, my dad is a stock broker who would've just been, like, his brain would be, like, [*brain exploding gestures.*]

I understand that that's his life and talking about, ""this is where I grew up, what I grew up knowing."" What you grew up knowing is much different. It's international.

Yeah.

It's the world. You've been traveling the world for a long time.

I completely understand what he was saying there, because, I mean, with me, it's the same thing. It's like, as my life has changed, I need to continue to write about it, and I need to continue to write about even the things that change, like moving to New York and, you know, focusing more on my girlfriends rather than boyfriends. Like, these are things that are, kind of, the focal point of this new album. And as much of when I was in high school, I would sing about what my life was, which was, you know, sneaking out at night, and driving in trucks with your first boyfriend, and falling in love, and that, kind of, innocent summer romance thing, small towns, dirt roads. That was actually my life in high school.
 It's not anymore. So if I were to continue to write songs about that, I feel like it would be very disingenuous, and as a songwriter, that's the exact opposite of the goal I'm trying to accomplish.

In listening to the songs I've heard already, they're still, they're very much story songs. You tell a story in each one. There's a beginning, a middle, and an end, and that's something that you focus on.

Definitely. I mean, I think that's kind of engrained in me, and that's the one part of my songwriting that I don't think should change as everything else does. I think that my fans have gotten used to receiving my diary entries every two years, and getting that album and going, ""oh, this is what she's been through the last two years.""

I meet a bunch of people who are in the public eye, but not quite like, there's nobody in the public eye like you. There's a few on the planet, and there's nothing that could prepare you for that. Am I right? There's nothing in life that could prepare you for that.

I feel really lucky because I don't feel like I was shot out of a cannon, you know? A lot of people have their first single come out and it is everywhere, and all of a sudden they have a triple-platinum single, and there's all this anticipation about their album and then, all of a sudden, people start to tear them down, and it all happens over the course of six months to a year. My career build, I mean, we're going on, it's about nine years now since I put out my first album?

The record label was signed in 2005, right? The record deal rather, sorry.

We're going on almost ten years, so it's been a really, really gradual arc, and that doesn't mean that sometimes it doesn't feel that it's at a crazy fever pitch that no one could ever prepare you for, but as much as you could possibly be prepared for it, I feel like time has kind of prepared me for it. I mean, some days I wake up and am absolutely overwhelmed by how abnormal my life is. It's not normal to have security with you wherever you go. It's not normal to have assistants. It's not normal to have hair and makeup every day. It's not normal -

To give you people heat for holding a cat a certain way on the streets of New York.

That cat loves being held like that!

I know! No, I know! But you can't do anything without somebody at some point on some website, ""well, the cat doesn't, this isn't right for the cat to be out like that.""


The cat loves it. The cat, here's the thing -

Is that Olivia?

Yeah, that's Olivia. Yeah, you're right, exactly. And when everything that you do is debated upon, scrutinized, questioned, everybody feels entitled to ask you why you did everything. There are days where I feel really, really okay with that, honestly, but then there are days where I just, am kind of overwhelmed by all of it, and I think that that's okay. I try to encourage my fans that they don't have to feel confident every day, they don't have to feel happy every day, they don't have to feel pretty every day, they don't have to feel wanted every day. That they shouldn't put added, extra pressure on themselves to feel happy when they're not, you know? I think being honest with yourself emotionally is really important.

When you signed that record deal in 2005, is there any advice you would go back and give to that girl that was signing that day? Or because the slow and gradual build it kind of worked out? I mean, it's obviously all worked out okay. What advice are you gonna give to somebody like that?

I don't think I'd wanna give her too much advice, I would... oh, I think I would tell her to laugh more. Just, you know, if you laugh at yourself first it's less funny when other people make fun of you. I would also explain to her the actual definition of feminism, because I didn't know it when I was younger.
 I think those are two important things for girls to know, going into this business or going into life itself. But all the other things, all the really intense, times I felt serious pain or rejection or humiliation or embarrassment, those have all produced the songs I'm the most proud of. There was this crazy circumstance that happened where I wrote this song ""Mean"" about the harshest criticisms I've ever gotten. It was brutal. And that song ended up winning two Grammys.


Spectacular, yeah. In hindsight you don't [?], but if you knew something was coming, if someone said to you, ""there's something coming around the corner, it's brutal, you're gonna want to, you know, hoodie for three weeks, you're never gonna want to deal with it. But the result will be Album of the Year.""

Oh my God, you'd do anything for that!

Fair enough. Like I said earlier, this is one of the things you don't get to do all the time. You get to go on stage a lot, you get to be interviewed a lot, all of these things happen to you, but album releases don't happen a lot.

They don't.

They don't happen a lot.

I'm really soaking it in.

Yeah? Do you still get as excited? I know you were saying you're more proud of this than any of them.

Yeah. I'm so excited, I mean, honestly. Because having spent the last year and a half, just kind of living my life on my own terms and not, not dating, not focusing on really anything else other than figuring out the album I wanted to make, there's such an incentive for me, like, I'm so proud of it. And I've always been proud of my albums, but there's something about this one, where I feel like I actually did something different this time. I actually made something that is cohesive and fits together and has its own sound and something I was so focused on. And I can be focused on my fans, and I can, you know, like, I'm not tired right now during this interview. Like, I'm not distracted, I'm just, kind of, I'm just, really taking it in.

The highs that you get on stage, almost nobody gets to experience, what you experience on stage. Which, again on the planet. You have one of those jobs that's very rare. What's second to that? What's the thing that comes the closest to the electricity that you feel when you're on stage?

I would say it's different all the time, but right now it's, like, seasonal stuff. Like, I get as excited about being on stage as I get about cozy things. Because just the idea of seasons changing. This is the time of year where I'm so out-of-control excited about the fact that it's fall. Guess what's next? Winter.

Yes, so you're gonna have a hard time getting anybody here excited about that.

It's two seasons that I love, and I can bake stuff all the time, and then I can give it to people. I can try out new recipes, I can wear sweaters, I can wear knee socks. I could even buy sweaters for my cats to wear.

Okay.

I could do any of that, because it's that kind of season!

But that's almost as exciting as being on stage in front of forty thousand people?

You have to understand that if you're choosing your first place as being something like, ""ahhhhhhh,"" the second place has to be something that evens that out, which is, like, baking day with your friends.

But your answer really is, ""I don't need another high like that, because that's the one I get by going on stage.""

I think that is actually my revised answer.

You mentioned feminism. You have, almost by happy accident, become a real icon for girls and women, and you said earlier that that would be one of the things you might make sure you would change if you were to go back and talk to younger you, is to, kind of, narrow down that definition, or define the definition of feminism. Do you realize, kind of, how great that it is for young girls to see what you're doing? I mean, you get to experience that [?], right? When you talk to parents of young girls, right?

That's awesome. It's interesting because I think that feminism is such an important conversation to be having. Especially right now, because with girls out there in the world living their lives, knowing what it means is so important, because all it means is that they feel they should be treated exactly the same way as guys. They should be given equal opportunities and rights. And I think the more people like Lena [Dunham] talk about it, like, Lorde and Emma Watson talk about it, and the fact that it's becoming, sort of, a conversation that is top-of-mind in the media. I think it's so incredible. I've always made music so I could feel camaraderie with my fans, not in a way that was trying to cater to, kind of, any male fantasy, and that wasn't on purpose, that's just been what has felt natural to me. When asked early on about feminism in my career, I just, I think I was probably fifteen the first time I was asked about it. And so I would just say, ""I don't talk about politics, I don't really understand that stuff yet, so I guess I'm just gonna say I'm not."" And I wish that when I was younger I would've known that it's simply hoping for gender equality.

Probably not so fair of the interviewer to ask a fifteen-year-old about that.

You know, that's an interesting point to make. But I think that, in the media, it's very interesting to witness, on a daily basis. You know, you go online, and we all see these gossip blogs every single time we log on, because we're curious and that's the society we live in. But you'll see these polls, like, ""vote on who has a better butt! This woman or this woman?"" And you never see ""who has a better butt: this man or this man?"" It just never happens. ""Who's the hotter mama: this woman or this woman?"" It's not, like, ""who's the sexiest dad: this man or this man?"" You just don't see it. And people are allowed to pit women against each other and vote, and they think it's an innocent thing, when really it's kind of warping your mind that, you know. And if a young girl logs on and votes, it's like she's going, ""oh my God, if that girl in my class is pretty and smart, then maybe everyone's comparing me to her, and maybe I should hate her.""
 And that's just, it's feeding this negativity and I really think that with girls, kind of, banding together, in music, in culture, in movies, whatever. I think it's nice to see people actually cheer each other on and girls be friends with each other, because hopefully that will kind of bleed into the classroom, and the playground, and the campus, and all that.

I know it seems like disposable entertainment for adults, but it's not only adults who are seeing this stuff.

It's mostly not adults.

It's mostly not adults.

It's mostly very impressionable kids and young girls who are still forming their ideas of who they actually are. And to warp their opinions of other girls, that just adds anxiety to their life that they don't need.

This kind of brings me to talking about your legacy, and I know, I think five albums in it's appropriate to start talking a little bit about that. I'm guessing that you try very hard to make sure that the music you make, you release the things you take part in enough, that they'll all be able to stand up. Not just to the test of time, say, sonically or whatever, but that you can continue to be proud of this, is that right?

Yeah, it's completely right, it's dead-on. I've always had this thing where I think about what, if I'm lucky enough to have grandkids someday, what they would say. If they looked back on pictures, and videos, and things like that, and I'd sure they'd laugh at me and make fun of my awkwardness and things like that. But I would never want to embarrass them. It's interesting because it's like the whole role model question, like, are you a role model? Do you think about the little kids in the front row when you're doing all the things you're doing in this life?
 I think that's an unnecessary pressure to put on yourself, but it's easier when you make it about your own life, your own legacy, when you, kind of, bring it in house, and you're, like, ""what if I have a five-year-old someday? And what if someday my ten-year-old goes online for the first time? Like, what do I want her to see about me?""

That's a pretty good way to look at it.

It's something that happens very naturally where if you're, kind of, just taking accountability and responsibility for your own actions, it's kind of a natural thing that happens, where, you know, all of a sudden you have parents coming up and thanking you, and you're just, sort of, like, ""hm, well, you're welcome."" Where you were just, kind of, trying to live a good life, because I think, you know, you don't want to feel like you're the national president of the babysitters club, but you do wanna try to do good things, and make ripples, and good echoes in society, and culture, and all that.

But you are doing that, and in the music that I've heard already, man, are people gonna get a kick out of hearing this, and experiencing it live. It's great, congratulations on this.

Good. Thank you!

It's epic. The album's out.

Thank you! It's great to talk to you, as always.

As always. Thanks, Taylor.

Awesome.

Nice job.

Thanks! You're so good!

Thank you, thank you for doing this.

I always end up telling you stuff that I've never thought to say in interviews."

Closest to a Cowboy Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I drive around this town
In a Mustang with the top down
And six running horses under my hood

Well that’s good enough for me
Don’t need the real thing
That’s just another thing
For me to try to tame
Don’t know if I could
It might just break me
I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be riding off with him

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me


[Verse 2]
Before I met him
I was so sane and grounded

Before he taught me how to lie
And crawl out the window
I learned the dirt roads

And I got my heart broken
Cause that cowboy taught me how to cry
And how to let go

I thought there for a little while
Every sunset I’d be riding off with him


[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me


[Bridge]
It was all a little
Wonderful and strange
But I’ll never look
At a sunset the same night

[Chorus]
Snap buttons on a denim shirt
Blue jeans and a little dirt
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
Sitting fishing by the river bank
Swimming in the water tank
That’s the closest you’ll see me
Feet hanging out a pickup truck
Crazy and a little rough
Running free
That’s the closest to a cowboy
You’ll see me"

Who I’ve Always Been Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You walk in here with your guitar man

Your shiny boots and your full-on band
A smile on your face, a knife in your hand
Singing songs you've got memorized
With whatever talent money buys
So polished that it slips right through your hands

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But don't worry yourself, I ain’t your competition
Don't flatter yourself, that was never my intention

[Chorus]
I want to talk about what you are that I ain’t
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you
And that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood, and sweat, and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be
And who I've always been


[Verse 2]
I walk in here with a beat-up case
The same guitar I've always played
And the words I wrote down on a page
When I was 12 years old and small town raised
You tell the crowd you're paying dues
I tell them, ""This is what I do""
And it’s what I put my life into
As I breathe the smoke and cheap perfume


[Pre-Chorus 2]
And say, life on Musical Row is rough conditions
But the easy ride was never my ambition

[Chorus]
I want to talk about what you are that I ain’t
Let's talk about what you do that I can't
Let's talk about me and you
And that empty room and who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood, and sweat, and tears
Let's talk about what you want to be
And who I've always been, oh

[Bridge]
Let's talk about your childhood days
You were the prom queen, I was on this stage
So where's that crown gotten you these days
When it's me and you and the same damn games?


[Chorus]
So what have you got that I ain't?
And what do you do that I can't?
Let's put me and you in an empty room
And see who wins
Let's talk about what you did to get here
Let's talk about blood, and sweat, and tears

Let's talk about who you want to be, girl
And who I've always been (Who I've always been)"

American Girl Lyrics
“American Girl” is a cover of a song of the same name by Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
[Verse 1]
Well, she was an American girl
Raised on promises
She couldn't help thinking that there was a little more to life
Somewhere else

After all it was a great big world
With lots of places to run to
And if she had to die trying
She had one little promise she was going to keep


[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl


[Verse 2]
Well, it was kind of cold that night
She stood alone on her balcony
She could see the cars roll by
Out on 441
Like waves crashing on the beach


And for one desperate moment there
He crept back in her memory
God, it's so painful
It's something that's so close but still so far out of reach



[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
She was an American girl


[Chorus]
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Make it last all night
Oh yeah, all right
Take it easy baby
Oh, take it easy now


[Outro]
Oh yeah, all right
She was an American girl"

willow (lonely witch version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand

Wreck my plans, that's my man


[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man



[Bridge]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars

Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man



[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

Midnights [Liner Notes] Lyrics
What keeps you up at night?

It's a momentary glimmer of distraction. The tiniest notion of reminiscent thought that wanders off into wondering, the spark that lights a tinderbox of fixation. And now it is irreversible. The flame has caught. You're wide awake.

Maybe it's that one urgent question you meant to ask someone years ago but didn't. Someone that slipped through the cracks in your history, and they're too far gone now anyway. All the ghost ships that have sailed and sailed away, but at this hour, they've anchored in your harbor. They sit with flags waving, bright and beautiful. And it's almost likе it's real.

Sometimes sleep is as еvasive as happiness. Isn't it mystifying how quickly we vacillate between self love and loathing at this hour? One moment, your life looks like a night sky of gleaming stars. The next, the fog has descended. Suddenly you're in the town you left behind all those years ago. The trees of your youth with the phantom memory echoes of your belly laughter, and the rope indentations of your old tire swing still on the branch. All the phone numbers you still know by heart but never call anymore.
 The boy's devastated face as he peeled out of your driveway. The family man he is now.
What must they all think of you.

Why can't you sleep? Maybe you lie awake in the aftershock of falling headlong into a connection that feels like some surreal cataclysmic event. Like spontaneous combustion, or seeing snow falling on a tropical beach. A lavender haze crush that feels like the crash of a wave.

Or was tonight the night you realized how solitary, how alone you really are, no matter how high you climb. The elevation just makes it colder.

Some midnights, you're out and you're buzzing with electric current — an adventurer in pursuit of rapturous thrill. Music blaring from speakers and the reckless intimacy of dancing with strangers. Something in this shadowy room to make you feel shiny again. On these nights, you know that there are facets of you that only glow in the dark.

Why are you still up at this hour? Because you're cosplaying vengeance fantasies, where the bad bad man is hauled away in handcuffs and you get to watch it happen. You laugh into the mirror with a red wine snarl. You look positively deranged.

Maybe you were trying to mastermind matters of the heart again. You've gotten lost in the labyrinth of your head, where the fear wraps its claws around the fragile throat of true love. Will you be able to save it in time? Save it from who? Well, it's obvious. From you.

We lie awake in love and in fear and in turmoil and in tears. We stare at walls and drink until they speak back. We twist in our self-made cages and pray that we aren't — right this minute — about to make some fateful life-altering mistake. This is a collection of music written in the middle of the night, a journey through terrors and sweet dreams. The floors we pace and the demons we face. For all of us who have tossed and turned and decided to keep the lanterns lit and go searching. Hoping that just maybe, when the clock strikes twelve...we'll meet ourselves.

See you there. Midnight sharp.

Carolina (Video Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Oh, Carolina creeks running through my veins
Lost I was born, lonesome I came
Lonesome I'll always stay
Carolina knows why for years I roam
Free as these birds, light as whispers
Carolina knows

[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't see me here
No, they never did see me here
And she's in my dreams

[Chorus]
Into the mist, into the clouds
Don't leave
I make a fist, I make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know

[Verse 2]
Carolina stains on the dress she left
Indeliblе scars, pivotal marks
Blue as the life shе fled
Carolina pines, won't you cover me?
Hide me like robes, down the back road

Muddy these webs we weave


[Pre-Chorus]
And you didn't see me here (Mhm)
They never saw me

[Verse 3]
Oh, Carolina knows why for years they've said
That I was guilty as sin and sleep in a liar's bed
But the sleep comes fast, and I'll meet no ghosts
It's between me, the sand, and the sea

ME! Lyrics
[Intro]
Promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I talk
And you're the kind of guy the kids all like
(And there's a lot of cool kids out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool kids out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to another
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


[Verse 2]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to another
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge]
Hey, kids!
Spelling is fun!
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
Promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
You can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want you, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you

I Forgot That You Existed (Piano/Vocal) Lyrics
[Spoken Intro]
So the clip that you're about to hear is my preparation for a writing session. I was writing with two writers I hadn't ever worked with before, so I wanted to come in with an idea that was pretty much all there, melody and lyrics. And so I had this idea called ""I Forgot That You Existed"", and I wanted it to be really simple. I thought it might be a really fun way to open the album, like, basically kind of shrugging off a lot of things that you've been through that have been causing a lot of struggle and pain and just, one day, you wake up and you realize you're indifferent to whatever caused you that pain. And so this is a clip of me just trying to tinkering around on the piano, trying to figure out exactly what I wanted to do with it, and you can hear the end result on the album, but this is where it started

[Sung]
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice

(Humming)
I forgot that you existed
I forgot that you existed
Thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice

I forgot that you existed
How I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and

How many nights I, how you did me
How many days did I wait thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
(Humming)

I forgot that you existed
I thought I'd miss you but I didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed"

Breathless Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Here you are now
Fresh from your war
Back from the edge of time
And all that you were
Stripped to the bone
I thought you'd want to know


[Chorus]
That when you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless

Breathless

[Verse 2]
Lay down your guns
Too weak to run
Nothing can harm you here
Your precious heart
Broken and scarred
Somehow you made it through
I only ask that you won't go again



[Chorus]
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless


[Bridge]
I'm so glad to see you smiling
So good to hear your laugh
I think that you've found you even
Missed yourself
I'm only asking this because I think that
Truth be told
Oh, you'll never go again
Again
, again

[Chorus]
When you feel the world is crashing
All around your feet
Come running headlong into my arms
Breathless
I'll never judge you
I can only love you
Come now running headlong
Into my arms
Breathless
Breathless



[Outro]
When you feel the world is crashing
Come running into my arms"

[Verse 1: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic]
You're sort of famous, a minor celebrity
And so it only makes sense the world would be
Obsessed with every single thing you do
They're running 'round with their camcorders in the night
They're lurking patiently and hoping that they just might
See something real embarrassing you do

[Pre-Chorus: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic]
The bad hair day
 and sweat-stained t-shirt
That's the story that they're gonna feature
With exclusive pics of your flabby behind

You think you're all alone, but that's right when you'll find

[Chorus: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic]
A bunch of paparazzi popping out of nowhere
Cameras in your face, and then suddenly
You're on TMZ, you're on TMZ

[Verse 2: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic]
Following you when you're walking down the street
And asking stupid questions while you're trying to eat
So you cover your face, thinking to yourself
""Hey, isn't this creepy?""
And they're out there praying you'll have a big meltdown
And take 'em on a little car chase through this whole town

They'll be there with you when you're going to jail
First on the scene for every wardrobe fail



[Pre-Chorus: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic]
You just picked up some transvestite

Seconds later, it's up on the website
Get a Vegas wedding, a quickie divorce

And they'll be sneaking in, snapping pictures, of course

[Chorus: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic]
And if they ever catch you picking your nose
Or stumblin' down the street on a drunken spree
You're on TMZ
Stalking you, just waiting by your front door
Trailing you through airport security
They're with TMZ, they're with TMZ

[Skit: Tom Kenny
]
""We caught this Oscar nominee picking up dog poop!""

""Is that a baby bump?""

""I pronounce you guilty... of leaving the house while fat!""

""Look who's drinking coffee!""

""Everything celebrities do is fascinating!""


[Bridge: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic]
Oh, let me tell you
It's getting to the point where a famous person can't
Even get a DUI or go on a racist rant

Those guys are all around, so you really shouldn't dare
Go to every club in town if you've lost your underwear



[Chorus: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic]
Seems that every single time a star decides to
Shave their head
 or ram their car into a tree

They're on TMZ
If they catch you peeing in the bushes
Later on that night, well, I guarantee
You're on TMZ, you're on TMZ

[Outro: ""Weird Al"" Yankovic]
You're on TMZ
Every single celebrity knows they're gonna be
There on TMZ"

What To Wear Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She's looking in the mirror
The moment's getting nearer
She thinks about it as she walks her walk
Up and down the staircase
Make up fresh on her face
She thinks about it as she talks her talk

[Verse 2]
School dance, first chance
Always been a dreamer
There's one guy, she's shy
Sees him through the mirror
And everybody looks at her
She thinks about it
Blue dress, angel face
Looking in the mirror
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

[Chorus]
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you got to love her
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear


[Verse 4]
She's standing in her bedroom
He'll be pulling up soon
She thinks about it when she sees headlights
Looking out the window
She's got her diary to show
That she's been waiting for this all her life
First date, can't wait
Looking in the mirror
Heart all wrapped up
Wait until he sees her
He's looking right at her
She thinks about it
Sixteen blue jeans, Abercrombie T-shirt
Shoes, purse, hair tied back
And you should see her
She's got her magic
Floating through the air

[Chorus]

[Bridge]
The years went by
The mirror saw her cry
She got up again
She got up again
The wind blew by
The small town lights
She got up again
Move out, find out
Where the world can take her
Bright lights, late nights
Living for the greater
Move to Paris
Living on a prayer



[Chorus]
Peace, love
One thing leads into another
Dream big, aim small
Man you got to love her
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
She's got her hopes up
Got them up to there
Wondering what to wear

[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Wondering what to wear"

Who’s Afraid Of Little Old Me? (First Draft Phone Memo) Lyrics
Okay, I'm gonna try to play this in one go
Um, this is called ""Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?""

[Verse 1]
The who's who of ""Who's that?"" is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about ""sad""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Nothing makes me feel more alive

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
You should be

[Verse 2]
The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me that I'm bad



[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Is it a wonder I brokе? Let's hear one morе joke
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Then we could all just laugh until I cry

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean

""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?
You should be

[Post-Chorus]
You should be, you should be
You should be, you should be, you should be

[Bridge]
So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?
And say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me

So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singin' along


[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til your circus life made me mean

""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be

[Post-Chorus]
You should be, you should be
'Cause you lured me
And you hurt me
And you taught me

[Outro]
You caged me and you called me crazy
I am what I am, well, 'cause you trained me
So who's afraid of me?
Who's afraid of little old me?
Who's afraid of little old me?

For the most part that was almost, sort of, almost what it should be. I'm gonna work on the melodies and the bridge so they don't become repetitive like that. But that's just the like framework and I might take some things out, but. Yeah, just a song about being crazy"

Taylor Swift’s First Phone Call With Tim McGraw Lyrics
[Radio DJ]
Hey a little bit ago we were talking about uh, songwriting and listening to songs and putting down what you feel in the song, and um, up next in the countdown is Taylor Swift, and have you heard this song yet?

[Tim McGraw]
I have heard this song

[Radio DJ]
Tim McGraw. And what what did you think the first time you heard it? Or how was the first time?

[Tim McGraw]
It was awesome. Uh, except for, I didn't know if I should, I should take it as a compliment or I should feel old?

[Radio DJ]
Ah, ha ha ha

[Tim McGraw]
I didn't know which one but the more, the more I hear it the more, I don't know if its true or not, but I start taking it as a compliment and not that I feel that I'm old, I don't know if that's true, but that's what I choose to think.

[Radio DJ]
Why don't we find out. Taylor is a compliment, or uh, he's old?

[Taylor Swift]
Oh its definitely a compliment. Yeah. (Laughing)

[Radio DJ]
Tim McGraw, meet Taylor Swift.


[Tim McGraw]
Nice-

[Taylor Swift]
Nice to meet you.

[Tim McGraw]
Nice to meet you, Taylor. How you doing?

[Taylor Swift]
I'm doing great. How are you doing?

[Tim McGraw]
I'm doing good. Congratulations on your record. It's doing great.

[Taylor Swift]
Thank you so much. I'm just so excited. Thank you for, uh, having good... music and everything. I swear I'm not a stalker (Laughing)

[Radio DJ]
Well-

[Taylor Swift]
The funny thing about this song is ya know, as a writer, some of the songs that you write like four hours, you'll do them writing a song and it'll be good and everything but I wrote this one in literally 15 minutes. And ya know, I really didn't think anything about calling in Tim McGraw so I kinda shelved it for like three months and never even thought that it was going to be a single. But, um, my label heard it and was like, ""we're putting that out.""(Laughing)

[Tim McGraw]
Well, I'm glad ya did, 'cause, um, it's doing well for ya.


[Radio DJ]
So I-, so I understand that you two guys have not talked.

[Tim McGraw]
No.

[Radio DJ]
You haven't met.

[Tim McGraw]
No.

[Taylor Swift]
No, we've never talked or met or anything.

[Tim McGraw]
I sent her a message one time. I think with Entertainment Weekly
Or something like that. Oh, I don't remember what show it was. I was doing an interview and they were going to interview Taylor the next day. So, I sent her a little message, so, I don't know if she got it or not.

[Taylor Swift]
Oh my God. They never gave that to me.

[Tim McGraw]
They didn't? Okay, well, there ya go. I did. (Laughing)

[Radio DJ]
So I-I.


[Taylor Swift]
We've just officially never never talked or messaged or anything.

[Tim McGraw]
Not at all.

[Radio DJ]
So I thought, I think it's pretty brave to put out a song called Tim McGraw without maybe talking to Tim McGraw. Did you mind?

[Taylor Swift]
It was definitely kind of a chance. Ya know, I didn't say anything bad in the song so I was kinda thinking, ya know, he wouldn't take it too bad.

[Tim McGraw]
Well, thank you for that. Thank you for not saying anything bad
I'm sure there's plenty that could've been said. Tell me-

[Taylor Swift]
Could you tell Faith that I said hello?

[Tim McGraw]
I sure will. I sure will. And she loves the song too by the way.

[Taylor Swift]
Oh my gosh, she's awesome.

[Tim McGraw]
I agree.

[Radio DJ]
This, this...Tell me about writing a song. Um, did this, did this really happen?

[Taylor Swift]
Well, yeah. I mean, I never really kinda went into this writing
Session on I'm gonna write a song called Tim McGraw
Um, yeah. because, that would just be weird. But um... (Laughing).
I actually this this is kinda strange, but I actually came up with the
melody and ideas for this song in math class in my freshman year
of high school.

[Tim McGraw]
Now I feel old.

[Taylor Swift]
And um, I was sitting there and was kind of started singing it to myself. And I was going through a period where I was dating this guy that was going off to college and I knew we were gonna break up. So I started to think about all the things that I knew would remind him of me. And it's kinda like a given one of all my friends ya know? That my favorite songs are Tim McGraw songs. They just are.

[Tim McGraw]
Aww, thank you.

[Taylor Swift]
And uh, you know so I kinda just thought about that first. And so it pointed to the song and just sat down at that piano. And wrote it with this co-writer who was kinda wondering if I was crazy or not but it turned out alright. And ya know, the funny thing is that I shelved this song for like three months and never never even played it for anybody, never even demoed it. And uh, then one time I was just goofing around and played it for my record label president and he goes, ""Well, that's your first single."" (Laughing)

[Taylor Swift]
And I'm like, well.

[Tim McGraw]
Well, you can write songs about me anytime, Taylor (Laughing)

[Taylor Swift]
That's awesome. There's a part two coming out next month.

[Tim McGraw]
Alright, great (Laughing)

[Tim McGraw]
Well, congratulations 'cause it's your first single. First top ten hit and thats pretty exciting. And I know you're off to the races here.
You're just doing great and, uh, congratulations, very exciting for you!

[Taylor Swift]
Awesome, its been so exciting, Tim, when are you gonna start like bringing out opening acts again?

[Tim McGraw]
Um, I don't know. I don't know. We'll have to look into that. (Laughing)

[Taylor Swift]
Well, I'll, I have someone who I think will be really perfect for it.

[Tim McGraw]
Ya do? What would-

[Taylor Swift]
Yeah.

[Tim McGraw]
What would their name be?

[Taylor Swift]
Uh, um, I think Taylor something.

[Tim McGraw]
Something like that, yeah

[Taylor Swift]
But.

[Tim McGraw]
Well, I'll, I'll be more than happy to have you out with me.

[Taylor Swift]
Just consider it.

[Radio DJ]
Ah, well that's very good! You're pretty fearless, Taylor Swift
. I'll tell ya that.

[Tim McGraw]
Right she's, she's gonna be forward this time.

[Radio DJ]
I think so. Country Countdown USA is now a booking agency as well.

[Tim McGraw]
Absolutely.

[Radio DJ]
Hey Taylor, I know you're on the road, thank ya so much for joining us.

[Taylor Swift]
It was awesome and thank you. It was good to meet you, Tim.

[Tim McGraw]
You too. Good talking to you. Bye bye now.

[Taylor Swift]
Bye.

Good luck out there.

You look at me

That I want and I'm needing

I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl ya talk about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

You talk to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
But I can't even see
Anyone when you're with me

You say you're so in love, you finally got it right
I wonder if you know you're all I think about at night

You're the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
You're the song in the car

You walk by me
Can't you tell that I can't breathe?
And there you go, so perfectly

Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky cause

The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
You're the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

And you're all that I need to fall into

You Belong With Me Lyrics
For All Those Sleeping covered “You Belong With Me” originally by Taylor Swift for the compilation album Punk Goes Pop 4.
[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your boyfriend, he's upset
He's going off about something that you said
'Cause he doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of bands he doesn't like
And he'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He wears jerseys, I wear t-shirts
He's team captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
You belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you in your worn out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since he brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doin' with a dick like that?


[Pre-Chorus 2]
I wear Toms and he wears sneakers
He's banging your friend underneath the bleachers

I'm dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus 2]
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
I think I know where you belong
I think I know it's with me

[Breakdown]
Why can't you just fucking see?
Why can't you just fucking see?
You belong to me
You belong to me
You belong to me


[Chorus 2]
If you can see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me"

[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear

Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Take me out, and take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover


[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover

Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover

My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue

All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

Writing Songs About You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I can't believe you did it again
Walked by and took my heart with you
Why did you have to look so good?
Don't you know that I'm trying to hate you
Trying to have a dream without you in it

But how can I put out this fire
When you're the one who lit it

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

[Verse 2]
I've got a stack of papers so high
And it's all about you baby
Keep thinking maybe I
Can make sense of something crazy
Something I can't get out of my Head
I write your name I write your name
Then I tear it all to shreds


[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do
I'll keep writing songs about you

[Verse 3]
And if you ever change your mind
And want me back again
I hope these songs will remind me
Why I shouldn't let you in

[Chorus]
I can't wait for the day I stop pretending
That I'm really OK cause I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be
Over you for real
Until I do

I'll just wait for the day
I stop pretending
That I'm really OK when I'm not
I want to know how it feels to be over you for real
Till I do
I'll keep writing songs about you"

Love Story (Digital Dog Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please, don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Breakdown]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


[Chorus]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

I Wished on a Plane Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim


Like the tree we carved our names in

There must be an explanation
Guess it didn't get enough rain
I need reasons why you're leaving

[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star

I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written on your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Verse 2]
Diving off into the deep end
Honestly believed you'd be there
When I jumped in
Guess it ain't your territory
We had the perfect love story

Except the ending
Nothing comes true
When it comes to you, oh


[Chorus]
Well I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
I guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Bridge]
The night was so cloudy
It's not my fault
I just couldn't see


[Chorus]
And I guess I wished on a plane
I thought it was a star
Guess what you wrote on paper
Wasn't written in your heart
Could've sworn you said you loved me
I guess I heard you wrong
And I guess I wished on a plane
That I thought was a star

[Outro]
Throwing pennies at the fountain
When you're standing on a mountain
It's kind of hard to aim"

Ten Dollars and a Six Pack Lyrics
Ten Dollars and a Six Pack is a song written and sung by young Taylor swift. The song is about an attractive country boy who Taylor thought she could never have. Even though everyone tells her that he was… Read More 
[Verse 1]
You were what I wanted

When I wanted what I just couldn't have
You were country lovin'
Really somethin' for three months and a half
Everybody said that you were bad news
But, baby, I was betting on you

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's ""I told you so""

But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Let them say we're crazy""
You said, ""Let's go fishing tonight""
The midnight moon was blazing, baby
I was looking into your eyes
Everything changed when you took me to town
Caught you staring every other girl down

[Chorus]
So I guess I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
I guess I'm gonna have to listen to my mama's ""I told you so""
But you ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack


[Bridge]
Can't believe the time you lost me
Can't believe what it cost me

[Chorus]
I owe my friends ten dollars and a six pack
Got myself a big country serving of payback
Had to go and listen to my mama's ""I told you so""
You ain't never been through that
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack
You ain't worth all that, ten dollars and a six pack"

Love Story Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh
Mm, oh, oh
Oh, ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said


[Chorus]
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

That’s Life Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Like one of those fireflies
Oh, it looks so good till it's in your hand
It's like one of those memories
Where you can't let go but you just can't stand
It's like one of those crazy dreams
And the permanent screens in the magazines
Saying, ""Why'd I love?
All it does is break your heart""


[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

[Verse 2]
Like one of those people
With the beautiful eyes and the perfect face
It's like one of those stories
Where the hero dies in the very last race
Like one of those endless cries
And the crazy lies of a hurting child
Saying, ""Why did love have to hurt?
It broke my heart""


[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

[Bridge]
I always liked to think
That I was always brave enough
To try to master any push-and-shove
Well I guess I never qualified love

[Chorus]
One morning does it all add up?
Or am I just standing on the edge of crazy?
You're getting close to giving up
In a big old way, knocks you down to the other side every time
Love or lie, live or die
I, well, I guess that's life

[Outro]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh, I guess that's life
Well, I guess that's life"

Don’t Hate Me for Loving You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
My momma stood across the room
Face to face but never eye to eye
Recalling words we said
The battle that we swore
We'd never fight
Breaking pieces off with every lie
A tear came to her eye
And she said

[Chorus]
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you block me out tonight
Honey where are you?
And don't hate me for loving you

[Verse 2]
He walked around my life
And made blind
With every single move
He caught me staring at him
Mad about him
Little that I knew
Love is different
When you play the fool
And all I want to do is say


[Chorus]
Don't walk away now
And don't rip my heart out
Don't you make cry tonight
Like you always do
And don't hate me for loving you

[Verse 3]
I slammed the door
Sat on the floor
Cried into my bed
Said are you there?
Do you even care?
To cross above my head
But someone said

[Chorus]
Don't turn away now
And don't rip my heart out
Things are meant to happen like this
I know it's right for you
And don't hate me for loving you

[Outro]
I looked up at the sky
Face to face and finally
Eye to eye"

Sugar Lyrics
[Verse 1]
What a thing to see
What a thing to be
What a perfect love, what a perfect home
'Cause every time she walks
And every time she talks
Is every time he knows what a perfect world he's living on

[Pre-Chorus]
But whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

[Chorus]
And he says, ""Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time""
He calls her ""Sugar"" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

[Verse 2]
With her midnight hair
And with his favorite stare
She's a southern belle, he's a rockout king
When she looks around
Oh, she knows she's found
Such a perfect life, such a perfect thing


[Pre-Chorus]
And whenever he's gone and when she's all alone
His heart goes out to her on the telephone

[Chorus]
And he says, ""Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time""
He calls her ""Sugar"" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

[Bridge]
Oh, there's a reason for every season
There's a change within the range of every heart
But the reason and the season
Seem to be right so far

[Chorus]
And he says, ""Sugar, how I love you
How I think about you all the time""
He calls her ""Sugar"" 'cause she's the sweetest thing
Oh, she's the best thing he'll ever find

[Outro]
He calls her ""Sugar"""

Speak Now (Live/2011) Lyrics
[Intro]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl


[Verse 1]
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""


[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen

But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me (Don't you?)

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
Your time is running out
And they said ""speak now""


[Interlude]
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said ""speak now""


[Chorus - Variation]
And you’ll say
""Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door""
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
""Speak now"""

For You (4 U) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes
It would've been good for you to be there
And every time you always would
Everything seems to have a picture perfect time
And nothing seems to be a blur

[Chorus]
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you

I'm saying one for you

[Verse 2]
Would've been cool to never fall down
But then I never would've seen
The power isn't with the picture perfect person
You told me better things to come from in between

[Chorus]
It's hard to see a picture drop before it hits the ground
It's nice to know you're here and you're helping me down
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one, saying one, saying one for you


[Bridge]
It would've been nice to see you coming
But that would've ruined the surprise
It would've been nice to have a picture perfect world
But then the truth would hurt my eyes

[Chorus - Shortened]
But you were always there when I needed
You would always see me clearly
And you were never looking for a thank you
I'm saying one for you"

You Do Lyrics
In “You Do,” Taylor describes how one boy has absolutely captivated her.
[Verse 1]
Here I am, once again
In your driveway, thinking I should be leaving
I should go but it's so entertaining watching you breathing

You went and got to me like
The stupid song on the radio that you try to forget
But it sticks in your head

So goodbye, it's not goodnight
Cause I'll be seeing you in my dreamin'

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
You got me, you do

[Verse 2]
In a daze, pull the shades
Close my eyes and picture you at my window
I relax, I go back to all the things you said
That only I know

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
You got me, you do


[Bridge]
I'm runnin' right out to my car
And I pull out the drive
It's only been ten minutes
But I have to see you one more time

[Chorus]
Boy, you got me like a shot to the heart
Got me shakin' so bad, spilled my coffee in the car
Caught a red light I ran right through
Gotta call my friends, tell them all about you
Always looking like one of those nights
When you're thinkin' 'bout kissing 'til the morning light
You got me, you do"

I like the way you wanted me
Every night for so long, baby
I like the way you needed me
Every time the things got rocky, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I was believing in you
Was I mistaken?
Do you mean
Do you mean what you say?
When you say our love could last forever

[Chorus]
Well, I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
I'd rather take a blow
At least then I would know
But baby don't you break my heart slow

And lead me on forever
While I stay at home
Still thinking we're together
I want our love to last forever

[Chorus]
But I'd rather you be mean
Than love and lie
I'd rather hear the truth
Than have to say goodbye
And I'd rather take a blow

Point of View Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Time is passing slowly for the eight-year-old next door
But Mama's watch is ticking off the wall
Jillian and Bobby think that they're a perfect pair
But girls could say he's just a bit too tall

[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

[Chorus]
Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

[Verse 2]
He hated pink so she threw out her favorite clothes
His NFL was turned to TLC
Baby's got an attitude and thinks they just don't know
But they all do and wish that she could see


[Pre-Chorus]
You don't have to do to win big
You just have to think it
Some folks say the glass is half full
Others choose to drink it

[Chorus]
Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

[Bridge]
In the least or masterpiece
Depends on one's opinion
Worst of all they never call
But don't think that they weren't wishing

[Chorus]
Some say the grass could be greener
And the other side ain't far away
But I say the old could be newer
And love still counts when it doesn't stay
Some say I love you
Some say love needs proof
It's all in your point of view

It's all in your point of view

Cardigan (alt version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, thеy assume you know nothing


[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving mе your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
I knew you
Steppin' on my last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter leaving Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing


[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a stolen kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
I knew I'd wish you would've changed your mind
I knew you'd miss me once the moment died
I knew to love would be to lose my mind
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

Making Up for Lost Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I need you more than I know how to mention
And I'd give forever to get your attention
Be your summer midnight with starry blue eyes
That only see you and are yours every night

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

[Chorus]
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

[Verse 2]
All of the days that I couldn't get it right
It all disappeared lying here by your side
With your dirty blue jeans and my crooked smile
You make it look easy changing my life


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this

[Chorus]
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

[Bridge]
Heaven had quite the time
To figure this life out
But baby I've got mine
To give you everything you dream about

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, love's like this
It's something I missed
Ooh, ooh, love's like this


[Chorus]
And that small town daydream
Lasted all night
'Cause tonight all those bright city lights
Just look at you look at me
Heaven looked down to see
We're falling now
And there's nothing we ain't too sure of
Just two kids making up for lost love

And that small town daydream

Riptide Lyrics
Taylor stepped into the Live Lounge at BBC Radio 1 to cover tourmate Vance Joy’s hit “Riptide” in October 2014. Interestingly, this was before Vance was announced to be opening for her on the 1989 World Tour.
I was scared of dentists and the dark
I was scared of pretty girls and starting conversations
Oh, all my friends are turning green
You're the magician's assistant in their dreams

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

There's this movie that I think you'll like
This guy decides to quit his job and heads to New York City
This cowboy's running from himself
And she's been living on the highest shelf

Oh, and they come unstuck

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong


I just wanna, I just wanna know
If you're gonna, if you're gonna stay
I just gotta, I just gotta know
I can't have it, I can't have it any other way
I swear she's destined for the screen
Closest thing to Michelle Pfeiffer that you've ever seen, oh

Lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong

Oh lady, running down to the riptide
Taken away to the dark side
I wanna be your left hand man
I love you when you're singing that song and
I got a lump in my throat because
You're gonna sing the words wrong
I got a lump in my throat because you're gonna sing the words wrong"

Lucky You (Acoustic) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There's a little girl in this little town
With a little too much heart to go around
Live forever, never say never
You could do better, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, ""Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Lucky you, lucky you""

[Verse 2]
She sings her little song, she walks along
A little pathway headed for the skies
Left to travеls, lives they unravel
Mind ovеr matter, that's what she says

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, ""Do-do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Do-do-do, do-do-do, do-do-do-do
Lucky you, lucky you, lucky you""


[Bridge]
Maybe she'll sing you do-do-do-do
Maybe she'll bring you into the skies
Honey, she'll love you, funny how some view
Angels above you aren't so far away

[Chorus]
Mama named her Lucky on a starlit night
A rabbit foot in her pocket, she dances in spite
Of the fact that she's different
And yet she's the same
And she says, ""Lucky you, lucky you"""

Clean/Long Live/New Year’s Day Lyrics
[Verse 1: Clean]
The drought was the very worst
Oh-oh, oh-oh
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth
Oh-oh, oh-oh

[Pre-Chorus: Clean]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus 1: Clean]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2: Long Live]
I said, ""Remember this moment in the back of my mind""
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in the stands went wild
We were the kngs and the queens
And they read off our names
The night we danced like we knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age


[Chorus 2: Long Live]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid""
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered""

[Bridge 1: Long Live]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
And hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground

[Verse 3: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus 3: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day


[Verse 4: New Year's Day]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus 4: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge 2: New Year's Day]
Please, don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please, don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Spoken]
I love you guys so, so, so, so, so much


[Verse 5: New Year's Day]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus 4: New Year's Day]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus: New Year's Day]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

[Outro: Long Live & New Year's Day]
And long live (Please, don't ever become a stranger)
The walls we crashed through (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
I had the time of my life (Please, don't ever become a stranger)
With you (Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere)
And long live
The walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life
With you"

Perfect Have I Loved Lyrics
[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

[Verse 1]
Do you remember the stupid things we used to do?
Before September stole me away from you?

The time we got your truck stuck in the creek?

'Cause, baby, roads weren't wild enough for you and me, sayin'

If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved

[Verse 2]
I used to see you by the bridge we used to cross
I found the feeling of trying to get lost
You would smile that smile that I tried so hard to forget
It's hard to douse a fire that I still haven't put out yet

[Chorus]
And if you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least you'll know
That, baby, perfect have I loved


[Verse 3]
Love was all we knew, and faith was growing on the vines
Words were all we had, and for one summer, you were mine
Sayin'

[Chorus]
If you love me then I love you, swear by the freckles on the moon
And maybe this will be enough
I'd like to keep you til I'm old, but if I can't, at least I'll know

Ain’t Nothing ’Bout You Lyrics
“Ain’t Nothing ‘Bout You” is a song originally by Brooks & Dunn. Taylor Swift covered it at Brooks & Dunn Final Rodeo.
[Intro]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me


[Verse 1]
Once I thought that love was something I could never do
Never knew that I could feel this much
But this yearning in the deep part of my heart for you
Is more than a reaction to your touch
It's a perfect passion and I can't get enough


[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me


Whoa

[Verse 2]
In my life I've been hammered by some heavy blows
That never knocked me off my feet
All you got to do is smile at me and down I go
And baby it's no mystery why I surrender

Girl you got everything



[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me


I love your attitude, your rose tattoo, your every thought
Your smile, you lips and girl the list goes on and on and on


[Chorus]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me
The way you kiss, The way you cry
The way you move when you walk by
There's aren’t nothing about you (there aren’t nothing about you)
That don't do something for me


[Chorus - Modified]
The way you look, the way you laugh
The way you love with all you have
Your dance, your drive, you make me feel alive



[Outro]
The way you talk, the way you tease
By now I think you see that
There aren’t nothing about you that don't do something for me"

[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line

I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
It's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-Whoa, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted


[Verse 2]
Stood there and watched you walk away
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing it was you instead


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-whoa, holding my breath
Whoa Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You are all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Bridge]
I know
I know
I just know
You're not gone, you can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I Can't go back, I'm haunted
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh- woah oh, oh)


[Outro]
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it"

[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones

When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick

Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's

Drunk under a streetlight, I

I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one

When you are young, they assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I

I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'


[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I

I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing


[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

Animal Lyrics
Swift performed a cover of Neon Trees “Animal” in Salt Lake City, Utah, during her 2011 Speak Now Tour, named after her 2010 album of the same name.
[Verse 1]
Here we go again
I kinda wanna be more than friends
So take it easy on me
I'm afraid you're never satisfied
Here we go again
We're sick like animals
We play pretend
So take it easy
And I'm afraid I won't get out alive
No, I won't sleep tonight


[Chorus]
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight


Neon Trees!


[Verse 2]
Here we are again
I feel the chemicals kickin' in
It's getting heavy
And I wanna run and hide
I wanna run and hide
I do it every time
You're killin' me now
And I won't be denied by you
The animal inside of you


[Chorus]
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh, oh
I want some more
Oh, oh
What are you waiting for?
Say goodbye to my heart tonight


[Bridge]
Hush, hush the world is quiet
Hush, hush we both can't fight it
It's us that made this mess
Why can't you understand?
Well, I won't sleep tonight


Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh


[Chorus]
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
Take a bite of my heart tonight
Oh oh
I want some more
Oh oh
What are you waiting for?
What are you waiting for?

What are you waiting

My Turn to Be Me Lyrics
“My Turn to Be Me” is one of Taylor Swift’s unreleased songs. She sings about breaking away from a controlling relationship with a guy, and finally being able to be herself again.
[Verse 1]
Something about me didn't fit into your perfect world
I bet the bluegrass stained your smile
You should use a darker color when you write on the wall
I haven't read it a thousand times


[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

[Verse 2]
You liked the face but you had to replace me
Inside I saw the walls of me go down
You can take the girl away from
Cowboy hats and steel guitars
She'll still sing the same old songs



[Pre-Chorus]
Maybe if you saw me for a second you would realize
Honey I was trying so hard

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me

[Bridge]
Turned on that radio
Hey that's when I realized
It wasn't our song, it was yours

And in conversation baby I was decoration
Now I deserve a little bit more than

[Chorus]
To talk, walk, think, stop
Anytime you want me to
Bend all my rules
I used to let you choose
Who you wanted me to be
This time I'm flying free
It's my turn to be me"

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me all alone
You found me
You found me
You found me-e-e-e-e
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me
Without me
Without me-e-e-e-e

[Pre-Chorus]
And she's long gone, when she's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Walked in)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Till you put me down
Oh, I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Walked in)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, she'll never see you cry
Pretends she doesn't know that she's the reason why
You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowni-i-i-ing
Now I heard you moved on, from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see
Now I see
Now I see-e-e-e-e

She was long gone when she met me
And I realize the joke is on me

I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?

They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'

On the way home
I wrote a poem

You say, ""What a mind""

And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings

Outside, they're push and shovin'

They said the end is comin' (They said the end is comin')

Don’t Blame Me (Originally By Taylor Swift) Lyrics
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I've been breaking hearts a long time
And toying with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
But something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacing, I just need you

For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, ""She's gone too far this time""

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
Just don't blame me, your love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life


My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
Just don't blame me, your love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life

I get so high, oh!
Every time yeah, every time you're lovin' me
You're loving me
Trip of my life, oh!
Every time yeah, every time you're touching me
You're touching me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life
Oh!


Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (Doesn't! Ain't doing it right!)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (Rest of my life...)
Just don't blame me, your love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doing it right (Doing it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be using for the rest of my life (Yeah, yeah yeah)"

The Fate of Ophelia (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I heard you calling on the megaphone

You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me (Me), myself (Myself), and I (I)
Right before you lit my sky up

[Chorus]
(All that time) I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
(Late one night) You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (Sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now), you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia


[Verse 2]
The eldest daughter of a nobleman
Ophelia lived in fantasy
But love was a cold bed full of scorpions
The venom stole her sanity

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me (Come for me)
I might've lingered in purgatory
You wrap around me like a chain (A chain), a crown (A crown), a vine (A vine)
Pulling me into the fire

[Chorus]
(All that time) I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
(Late one night) You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now), you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia


[Bridge]
'Tis locked inside my memory
And only you possess the key
No longer drowning and deceived
All because you came for me
Locked inside my memory
And only you possess the key
No longer drowning and deceived
All because you came for me

[Chorus]
(All that time) I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (I can see it all)
(Late one night) You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I can show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love’s a game, you want to play?
New money, suit & tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand

So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players and you love the game
So goddamn reckless, we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby, and I'll write your name

Stolen kisses, pretty lies

Wait the worst is yet to come
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keeping you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is she?"", you get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave

So it's gonna be forever or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over if the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers, they'll tell you I'm insane

So goddamn reckless, we'll take this way too far

the 1 (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying ""yes"" instead of ""no""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though

I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed

And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishеs came true
It would've been you
In my dеfense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone

But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one


[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count

You know the greatest loves of all time are over now


[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone

But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one


[Bridge]
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you

If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me

In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

willow (dancing witch version) [Elvira Remix] Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand

Wreck my plans, that's my man


[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind (wind)

Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man



[Bridge]
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind

They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind

But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars

Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art


[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

[Spoken]
Writing the song ""Lover"" was one of those magical experiences that you sometimes get to have as a songwriter. Um, I wrote it really quick in the middle of the night. As soon as I wrote it, I knew I wanted it to be the album title. And I knew that writing it kinda would depict the tone of the entire record. So it was a real catalyst for what this album turned into. And I wrote it alone, so I wanted to go in and play it for Jack Antonoff who I knew who would be the perfect person to produce it. And so I walked into the studio and I sat in the piano. And this is what happened So it is, it's basically, I don't see it as a piano. I think it's that like, kinda of, dreamy, guitary, throwback, but not like camp throwback, so.

[Sung: Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Sung: Chorus]

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Spoken]
Yeah, I love the walk down. I love the walk down. I was trying to figure out ""what the hell is gonna happen there""
So the, so.

[Sung]
My, my, my, my lover

[Sung: Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash on the couches
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all


[Sung: Chorus]

Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Spoken]
Okay and then I have this bridge thing that's um, essentially, Well, no I was, I did, I did it in this key, but it could be like a thing where it's like a key change. So it plays off of the walk down-ish. But it's, this is the melody of it, it goes, it's like

[Sung: Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hands
I take this magnetic force-
Oh, ****
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

[Spoken]
Wait, so goes...

[Sung: Bridge]
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat


[Spoken]
So goes, and you, it goes...

[Sung: Bridge]
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
My heart's been borrowed your heart's been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat

[Spoken]
You like? Yeah! I've never, I never do these cords, but, I was really at the piano, like, hashing it out yesterday."

The Black Dog (First Draft Phone Memo) Lyrics
[Intro]
Hey, so this is called, um, ""Old Habits Die Screaming
.""

[Verse 1]
I am someone who until recent events
You shared your secrets with
And your location, you forgot to turn it off
And so I watch as you walk
Into some bar called The Black Dog
And pierce new holes in my heart
You forgot to turn it off

[Pre-Chorus]
And it hits me
I just don't understand

[Chorus]
How you don't miss me in The Black Dog
When someone plays ""The Starting Line""

And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
Old habits die screaming

[Verse 2]
I move through the world with the heartbroken
My longings stay unspokеn
And I may never open up thе way I did for you
And all of those best laid plans
You said I needed a brave man
Then proceeded to play him
Until I believed it too


[Pre-Chorus]
It kills me
I just don't understand

[Chorus]
How you don't miss me in the shower
When remember how my rain-soaked body
Was shakin', do you hate me?
Was it hazing? For a cruel fraternity
I pledged and I still mean it
Old habits die screaming

[Bridge]
Weeks of breathin' clean air
I still miss the smoke
Are
 you makin' fun of me
With some esoteric joke?
Now I wanna sell my house
And set fire to all my clothes
And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
Even if I die screamin'
I hope you hear it

[Chorus]
And I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog
When someone plays ""The Starting Line""
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the magic
 fabric of our dreaming
But tail between your legs, you're leavin'


[Outro]
I still can't believe it
But
 old habits die screamin'"

Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too
You like the bad ones, too
You like the bad ones

[Pre-Chorus]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Drinking on a beach with you all over me

I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play


[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand prints on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks

So here's the truth from my red lips

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones, too


[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game

I Used to Fly Lyrics
[Verse I]
... I used to fly
Didn't matter where I'd been
'Cause I'd seen the sky
I wanna tell you why
But somehow I know I
Would break down and cry

[Chorus]
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

[Verse 2]
You... you know I would die
Before I let them see me
See me cry

Please don't leave tonight
Oh let me down slowly
Show me a light

[Chorus]
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight


[Bridge]
Oh let me think I'm strong
Please don't bring me down
I need you tonight

[Chorus]
I know you can't see me here
But I am not alone
I'm lying here in invisible arms
And I won't be alone tonight

Our Last Night Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Oh
We were standing in an empty room
The moonlight was falling
You were holding my hand when the car pulled up for you
And I could have spent a life with you
But those days are over
You were calling my name
When your face faded from view

[Pre-Chorus]
Wasn't it you that told me?
The sun would always chase the day
Wasn't it you that told me?

[Chorus]
Angels fly, in the air tonight
Saying wasn't it just like swimming out on the lake?
Stars collide in the air so light
Or was it just like those promises that you made? On our last night

[Verse 2]
Oh
I remember waking up with you
The days doing nothing
You meant more to me then, than you ever knew
You were going to be a doctor, a movie star, poet at a Nobel seminar
Hope the the world never tore that out of you


[Verse 3]
Tell me whatever happened to the things you loved?
And the songs we played and the Indian days
Whatever happened to the things you gave away?
Like Harold and martin singing
I was waving as you drove away
The sunlight was falling
You were riding backwards in a dusty window pane

[Chorus]
Angels fly in the air tonight
Was it just like the promises that we made?
And stars collide in the air so light
Was it just like those promises that you made?
On our last night
On our last night
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, yeah, oh"

Cross My Heart Lyrics
‘Cross My Heart’ is an unreleased acoustic song written by Taylor Swift when she was 12 or 13. This song is about wishing for a relationship with someone.
[Verse 1]
I’ve been counting days, and I’ve been being patient
About a little thing called love
Crossing all my fingers
Letting my heart linger
Trying to get some help from up above

[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t want to jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart and hope for you

Knock on wood and rope the moon

I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

[Verse 2]
Dreaming of you baby
I’ve been thinking maybe
There is something I can do
‘Cause I’ve been on the verge of
Running around in circles
Baby all I want is you


[Pre-Chorus]
I don’t want to jinx my luck
I’ve left it all behind me
And I’ve been hoping every day
That someday you will find me

[Chorus]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight

[Bridge]
Do you believe in miracles
Please tell me if you’ve seen one
I’d like to know just where to go
Because I think I need one

[Chorus x2]
So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight


So I cross my heart and hope for you
Knock on wood and rope the moon
I’ll pray for you and me and hope I’m right
And I wait around that old wishing well
You never know if time will tell
I cross my heart and hope for you tonight"

Eldest Daughter (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie

[Pre-Chorus]
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool

[Chorus]
But I'm not the baddest
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

[Verse 2]
You know, the last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine
That was the night I fell off and broke my arm
Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion
When your first crush crushes something kind
When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie


[Pre-Chorus]
Every eldest daughter was the first lamb to the slaughter
So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire

[Chorus]
But I'm not the baddest
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

[Bridge]
We lie back
A beautiful, beautiful time-lapse
Ferris wheels, kisses, and lilacs
And things I said were dumb
'Cause I thought that I'd never find that
Beautiful, beautiful life that
Shimmers that innocent light back
Like when we were young

[Pre-Chorus]
Every youngest child felt
They were raised up in the wild
But now you're home


[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not the baddest
And this isn't savage
And I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow (Never gonna break that vow)
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

[Outro]
Never gonna break that vow (Oh)
I'm never gonna leave you now, now
I'm never gonna leave you now"

Cornelia Street (Live from Paris) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar

""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go

As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home


[Chorus]
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again


[Verse 2]
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours

We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor

Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone


[Pre-Chorus]
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I


[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'll never walk Cornelia Street again


[Bridge]

You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside

Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen

[Chorus]
I hope I never lose you

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Oh, never again

'Cause baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again



[Post-Chorus]
I don't wanna lose you
I don't wanna lose you

I'm still wearing my blue jeans
No, I don't know what you mean
I'm still the same girl
Picking daisies in the field
I believe in what I feel
I've always been the same girl


Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch

Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world

I've always been the same girl

I still live in one small town
But always love to move around
I've always been the same girl
Still keep diaries that say
Where I was and did that day
I've always been the same girl


Some moments change your life
This could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking
Hey this could be fun

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl

Some days will change your life
Yeah this could be one of them
I'm just living life and thinking...

I've always been the same girl
Living in the same world
Singing little songs at the break of dawn girl
Sitting on the front porch
Do do do do do
Watching what you say girl
Never blow away girl
Living in the crazy world
I've always been the same girl


Living in the crazy world

Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?

Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground

The Future of Music Is a Love Story Lyrics
The Singer-Songwriter Says Artists and Fans Will Still Form Deep Bonds, but They Will Do It in New Ways via
Where will the music industry be in 20 years, 30 years, 50 years?


Before I tell you my thoughts on the matter, you should know that you're reading the opinion of an enthusiastic optimist: one of the few living souls in the music industry who still believes that the music industry is not dying…it's just coming alive

There are many (many) people who predict the downfall of music sales and the irrelevancy of the album as an economic entity. I am not one of them. In my opinion, the value of an album is, and will continue to be, based on the amount of heart and soul an artist has bled into a body of work, and the financial value that artists (and their labels) place on their music when it goes out into the marketplace.
 Piracy, file sharing and streaming have shrunk the numbers of paid album sales drastically, and every artist has handled this blow differently


In recent years, you've probably read the articles about major recording artists who have decided to practically give their music away, for this promotion or that exclusive deal. My hope for the future, not just in the music industry, but in every young girl I meet…is that they all realize their worth and ask for it

Music is art, and art is important and rare. Important, rare things are valuable. Valuable things should be paid for. It's my opinion that music should not be free
, and my prediction is that individual artists and their labels will someday decide what an album's price point is
. I hope they don't underestimate themselves or undervalue their art

Arrows Through the Heart

In mentioning album sales, I'd like to point out that people are still buying albums, but now they're buying just a few of them. They are buying only the ones that hit them like an arrow through the heart or have made them feel strong or allowed them to feel like they really aren't alone in feeling so alone. It isn't as easy today as it was 20 years ago to have a multiplatinum-selling album, and as artists, that should challenge and motivate us


There are always going to be those artists who break through on an emotional level and end up in people's lives forever. The way I see it, fans view music the way they view their relationships. Some music is just for fun, a passing fling (the ones they dance to at clubs and parties for a month while the song is a huge radio hit, that they will soon forget they ever danced to).
 Some songs and albums represent seasons of our lives, like relationships that we hold dear in our memories but had their time and place in the past

However, some artists will be like finding ""the one.""
 We will cherish every album they put out until they retire and we will play their music for our children and grandchildren. As an artist, this is the dream bond we hope to establish with our fans. I think the future still holds the possibility for this kind of bond, the one my father has with the Beach Boys and the one my mother has with Carly Simon

I think forming a bond with fans in the future will come in the form of constantly providing them with the element of surprise. No, I did not say ""shock""; I said ""surprise."" I believe couples can stay in love for decades if they just continue to surprise each other, so why can't this love affair exist between an artist and their fans?

In the YouTube generation we live in, I walked out onstage every night of my stadium tour last year knowing almost every fan had already seen the show online. To continue to show them something they had never seen before, I brought out dozens of special guest performers to sing their hits with me. My generation was raised being able to flip channels if we got bored, and we read the last page of the book when we got impatient. We want to be caught off guard, delighted, left in awe. I hope the next generation's artists will continue to think of inventive ways of keeping their audiences on their toes, as challenging as that might be

There are a few things I have witnessed becoming obsolete in the past few years, the first being autographs. I haven't been asked for an autograph since the invention of the iPhone with a front-facing camera. The only memento ""kids these days"" want is a selfie.
 It's part of the new currency, which seems to be ""how many followers you have on Instagram.""


Fan Power



A friend of mine, who is an actress, told me that when the casting for her recent movie came down to two actresses, the casting director chose the actress with more Twitter followers. I see this becoming a trend in the music industry. For me, this dates back to 2005 when I walked into my first record-label meetings, explaining to them that I had been communicating directly with my fans on this new site called Myspace. In the future, artists will get record deals because they have fans—not the other way around


Another theme I see fading into the gray is genre distinction. These days, nothing great you hear on the radio seems to come from just one musical influence. The wild, unpredictable fun in making music today is that anything goes. Pop sounds like hip hop; country sounds like rock; rock sounds like soul; and folk sounds like country—and to me, that's incredible progress. I want to make music that reflects all of my influences, and I think that in the coming decades the idea of genres will become less of a career-defining path and more of an organizational tool

This moment in music is so exciting because the creative avenues an artist can explore are limitless. In this moment in music, stepping out of your comfort zone is rewarded, and sonic evolution is not only accepted…it is celebrated. The only real risk is being too afraid to take a risk at all

Celebrity Spotlight


I predict that some things will never change. There will always be an increasing fixation on the private lives of musicians, especially the younger ones.
 Artists who were at their commercial peak in the '70s, '80s and '90s tell me, ""It was never this crazy for us back then!""
 And I suspect I'll be saying that same thing to younger artists someday (God help them). There continues to be a bad girl vs. good girl/clean-cut vs. sexy debate, and for as long as those labels exist, I just hope there will be contenders on both sides. Everyone needs someone to relate to

And as for me? I'll just be sitting back and growing old, watching all of this happen or not happen, all the while trying to maintain a life rooted in this same optimism

And I'd also like a nice garden"

This is why we can't have nice things, darling
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things

[Verse 2: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
It was so nice being friends again
There I was, giving you a second chance
But then you stabbed in the back while shaking my hand

And therein lies the issue
Friends don't try to trick you
Get you on the phone and mind-twist you
And so I took an axe to a mended fence


[Pre-Chorus 2: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
But I'm not the only friend you've lost lately
If only you weren't so shady

[Bridge: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
Here's a toast to my real friends
They don't care about the he-said-she-said
And here's to my baby
He ain't reading what they call me lately
And here's to my momma
Had to listen to all this drama
And here's to you
'Cause forgiveness is a nice thing to do
Haha, I can't even say it with a straight face

[Chorus 2: This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things]
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (Darling)
Because you break them
I had to take them away
This is why we can't have nice things, honey
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (And here's to my real friends)
Because you break them
I had to take them away (And here's to my baby)
This is why we can't have nice things, darling (He didn't care about that he-said-she-said)
Did you think I wouldn't hear all the things you said about me?
This is why we can't have nice things"

Mandolin Lyrics
[Intro]
He's got a nice little life
He's gonna live it, but on
Friday nights he plays that mandolin
Painted red, and he said
It's not the best I know
But it's mine, I'm gonna make it mine, oh yeah
Oh, oh, woah

[Verse 1]
People there can't help but care
About the friendly music of a guy
Who's getting by from their applause
He's got a song that moves along
He's got his local crowd tonight
At Angelina's family bar and grill


[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays Just Living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin
Oh yeah, mandolin


[Verse 2]
Got a car, got a scar
Like everyone he's got a few but
Everybody loves that mandolin
Got his problems, bills to pay
Somehow that boy finds a way
Through paychecks in tip jars, yeah

[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays Just Living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Mandolin

[Bridge]
Oh he's the kind of guy
Who never really wanted fame
His feet are planted firmly on the ground
He never wanted people to remember his name
He never wanted word to get around
That he found heaven on earth

[Chorus]
He's got his heart on his sleeve
The songs he plays Just Living free
But who knows what goes through his mind
When he plays a song it brings along
Everybody saying
Who's that guy who plays the mandolin
Oh, I'm the guy who plays the mandolin

Mandolin


[Outro]
Oh, oh, mandolin"

[Verse 1]
I like my music loud
I like my windows down
So I can scream
I like my trucks a little
Bigger than the rest
So I can see
Don't try me
Don't fight me
You be you and I'll be me

[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you

[Verse 2]
Your mom and daddy's walls
Are covered up in pictures of you
You never met a mirror
That you didn't look again into
So sorry, don't worry
I'm sure there are so many girls
Who love you like you do



[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you
It ain't you, oh

[Bridge]
Oh baby, don't persuade me
I know that you ain't used to no
So let me say it real slow

[Chorus]
They say I've always known
What I wanted, it's true
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
You will find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And they say I've always known
What I wanted
My friends and enemies
Will tell you it's true
And you'll find out
I always get it
I know what I want
And it ain't you"

Should’ve Said No (Alternate Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet

You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say

But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?


[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)

And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No, no
No, no, no, no



[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)

And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no

Love Story Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Julian""
I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's lеft to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll bе the prince too
It's a love story, baby, just say—

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Julian""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the prince too
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh baby, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Verse 3]
I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


[Chorus]
""Marry me, Julian, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

[Outro]
Oh, say ""Yes"""

Father Figure (Original Songwriting Voice Memo) Lyrics
[Spoken: Taylor Swift & Max Martin]
Wanna hear my two lines of the first—for the second verse? I'm really, really happy about them
Sorry, just a melody thing, sorry, sorry, so I don't forget
Ending the little tail, like, for one, mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift & Max Martin]
When I met you [?]
Stuck in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into- (Ba-doh)
Down into gold (Yeah)
Turn-
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold

[Spoken: Max Martin]
Yeah, like that

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Max Martin]
The winding road leads to the Chateau
The Chateau
You remind me

[Spoken: Max Martin & Taylor Swift]
I'm recording this after so you can focus on your thing
Okay
Two, three, four
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
The winding—

[Spoken: Taylor Swift & Max Martin]
Do you wanna go from the first of the first verse?
The beginning of the verse
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Max Martin]
When I found you, you were lost, wayward, stuck in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the Chateau
You remind me of a younger me
I saw potential

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I'll be your father figure
I'll drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil
Because my dick's bigger
This love is pure profit
Just step into my office
Don't cry, I know what you need

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Max Martin]
Leave it with me
I protect the family
Leave it with me


[Spoken: Shellback]
Almost like you want, almost like
""Leave it with me,"" just drums and vocals in the hook
Yeah

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I protect the family
Leave it with me
I protect the family

[Spoken: Taylor Swift & Max Martin]
Take away the music for a minute
Can I read you these first two lines of the second verse? I'm so excited about it
Two, three, oh, read
I wanna sing it
Two, three, four

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
I said ""They all wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign""

[Spoken: Taylor Swift, Max Martin & Shellback]
Said ""They all want you to rise, they don't want you to reign""
Yeah, yeah
They want you to rise, they don't want you to stay
Right


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
Well, I can teach you all the nam-na, the tricks of the trade
I taught you all the tricks of the trade

[Spoken: Max Martin & Taylor Swift]
Uh, yeah, yeah, the tricks of the trade's great there
Ah

[Verse 2: Shellback, Shellback, Max Martin & Taylor Swift]
I teach you all the tricks of the trade

[Spoken: Taylor Swift, Max Martin & Shellback]
And I, and I showed you all the tricks of the trade
And I, then I showed you all the tricks of the trade
Yeah
It's all leading to a battle
Yeah, yeah
Between, like, Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker
Yeah, exactly
Or Darth Vader and the Emperor, haha
Mm
Great
Uh, I showed you, uh
Great, great, great, great, great"

One Way Ticket (Eruption) Lyrics
“One Way Ticket” is a cover of LeAnn Rimes' 1996 song “One Way Ticket (Because I Can).” Based on the vocals, it seems like Swift recorded it around, or before, the age of 12.
[Verse 1]
Standing on the border
Looking out into the great unknown
I can feel my heart beating faster as I step out on my own
There's a new horizon and the promise of favorable wind
I'm heading out tonight, traveling light
I'm gonna start all over again

[Chorus]
And buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
I will fall in love again
Because I can

[Verse 2]
Gonna climb the mountain
And look the eagle in the eye
And I won't let fear clip my wings and tell me how high I can fly
How could I have ever believed
That love had to be so blind
When freedom was waiting, down at the station
All I had to do was make up my mind


[Chorus]
And buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
I will face the world around me
Knowing that I'm strong enough to let you go
I will fall in love again
Because I can

[Bridge]
Well, I have walked through the fire
And crawled on my knees through the valley of the shadow of doubt
Then the truth came shining like a light on me
And now I can see my way out

[Chorus]
Buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
See how far I can go
'Cause I'm gonna go out dancing in the pouring rain
And talk to someone I don't know
Buy a one-way ticket on a westbound train
I'm gonna have my breakfast with some pink champagne
Gonna sail the ocean, gonna spread my wings
Gonna climb that mountain, gonna do everything
Everything"

...Ready for It? (BloodPop® Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him

Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some

Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta


[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know


[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Yeah)
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (The night, my dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I'll take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor

Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now


[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (Night, in my dreams)
You should see the things we do, baby (We'd do, baby)
Yeah, in the middle of the night in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Post-Chorus]
Night, in my dreams
We'd do, baby
Yeah, in the middle of the night
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin


[Outro]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby"

cardigan / august / willow (Live From The 63rd GRAMMYs ® / 2021) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Cardigan]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus 1: Cardigan]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father

Running like water, I
'Cause when you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Verse 2: Cardigan]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-if's

The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back


[Refrain 1: Cardigan]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite
And you'd come back to me

[Verse 3: August]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more

Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

[Chorus 2: August]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Bridge: August & Willow]
Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""

So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend


[Verse 4: Willow]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
And now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

[Chorus 3: Willow]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand

Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Outro: Willow]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand

Wreck my plans, that's my man

That's my man

[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Hey, that’s my man
That’s my man
Yeah, that’s my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art (That’s my man)

That’s my man
Hey, that’s my man (That’s my man)

[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I can show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad girls good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the Queen, baby, I'm your King
Find out what you want
Be that guy for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my God, who is he?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed in a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Bridge]
Girls only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Girls only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers

Wildest Dreams Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds""
I thought, heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down


[Pre-Chorus 1]
She's so tall and handsome as hell
She's so bad, but she does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is


[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in your nice dress, staring at the sunset
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams
Your wildest dreams


[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
Her hands are in my hair, her clothes are in my room
Her voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now



[Pre-Chorus 2]
She's so tall and handsome as hell
She's so bad, but she does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is


[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in your nice dress, staring at the sunset, baby
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams
Your wildest dreams


[Bridge]
You see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
Bet all these memories will follow you around
Will follow you around, 'round


[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in your nice dress, staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks, say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams
Your wildest dreams
Say you'll remember me
Say you'll remember me"

Love to Lose Lyrics
Fed up with questions about why her relationship went sour, Tay sets the record straight and lets questioners know what it was really like.
[Verse 1]
Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out
Sorry for the inconvenience, I didn't mean to let you down
We were supposed to be forever but it's too bad you didn't see that to me
You were the perfect view of misery

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the days he called

There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

[Verse 2]
Let's talk about that golden boy that I met on a winter night
How was I supposed to know that he was just as cold inside?

He smiled and I smiled, well the camera's in your mind
And I lied, I swore that everything was fine

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called

There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose


[Bridge]
I know you wanna talk about me
How I gave up on love so foolishly
But keep in mind

[Chorus]
I never talked about the tears I cried
All the sleepless nights or the endless fights
I never talked about the nights he called

There was something wrong, it was all my fault
I had it all, what a shame, what a fall now
But in case you haven't heard the news
There wasn't much love to lose

Come on, gather 'round, I'm gonna tell you how the fire went out"

Sugar, We’re Goin Down Lyrics
At an Illinois stop of her 2011 Speak Now Tour, Taylor performed a cover of Fall Out Boy’s “Sugar, We’re Going Down.” According to Taylor Swift, she has liked Fall Out Boys since their debut album.
[Verse 1]
Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass, next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team


[Chorus]
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it


Fall Out Boy's from Chicago!


[Verse 2]
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you here from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost, but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team



[Chorus]
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it"

Fearless/I’m Yours/Hey, Soul Sister (Live/2011) Lyrics
First performed at London’s BBC Radio 2 in March 2011, this mashup became a fan favorite on the Speak Now World Tour.
[Fearless]
There's somethin' 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement
You walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot
Yeah


[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey


[Fearless]
Drivin' down the road
Wonder if you know
I'm tryin' so hard not to get caught up now
You're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly makin' me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless

So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one-horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger seat, you put your eyes on me
California now, capture it, remember it


And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless


[I'm Yours]
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours


[Hey, Soul Sister]
Hey, hey, hey


[Fearless]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me headfirst, fearless
I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless"

Safe and Sound Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, ""I'll never let you go""
When all those shadows almost killed your light

I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2]
Don't you dare look out your window, darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside your door keeps raging on

Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone...
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Watch me go into the world today
Watch me try to blow the past away
Watch me laugh and watch me cry
Watch me fall and watch me fly

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday, I'm gonna fly

Watch me catch a star and pin it down
Watch me live another time around
Watch me doubt the things I love
Watch me find what I'm proud of

'Cause I'm living in a brand new world
And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time
And keeping it mine
Someday, I'm gonna fly

And I may break my wings
And fall flat on my shattered heart
And I may hit the ground
But I will never fall apart

And you think I'm just another girl
But I'm living just a day at a time

Tennessee Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Standing on a street somewhere I don't wanna be
In a town that's made of stone
Some bad directions must have me here by mistake
'Cause this sure ain't what I call home

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can get out of here, and

[Chorus]
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by

And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

[Verse 2]
Standing on a road leading to a barn
With a cat named Eloise
Later on, we'll all go fishing in the pond
But all we'll catch is just a summer breeze

[Pre-Chorus]
Let me close my eyes for a second
See if I can stay right here, and


[Chorus]
Let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by

And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
And I'm in Tennessee

[Bridge]
When the pond is gone and Eloise floats away
I find myself staring at the same old day
I need to go back, back to where I feel so free
Well, it looks like I'm going back to Tennessee

[Chorus]
I let my hair hang down, and I can feel the golden sun
And watch a pickup truck drive by

And I wanna tell the world how good it is to be right here
But I don't, I just sit under this tree
Just me and Eloise
And I'm in Tennessee"

Blank Space Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sent
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my Gosh, look at that face
You look like my next first date
Love's a game, that we play (Hey)

[Verse 2]
No money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your backpack
 and my hand
I can make the bad days
 good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If it all was worth the pain
Got a long list of some others
They'll tell you I'm to blame

'Cause you know I love the haters
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll run this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of some others

They'll tell you I'm to blame
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty eyes
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what we want
Be that way for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no

[Verse 4]
Now I'm crying perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh my Gosh, who is she?""
I get lost on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, It's a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If it all was worth the pain
Got a long list of some others
They'll tell you I'm to blame
'Cause you know I love the haters
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of some others
They'll tell you I'm to blame
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

So it's gonna be forever

They want that yacht life, under chopper blades

They want those bright lights and Balenci' shades

And a fat ass with a baby face

They want it all
They want that complex female character

They want that critical smash Palme d'Or

And an Oscar on their bathroom floor

They want it all

[Pre-Chorus]
And they should have what they want
They deserve what they want
Hope they get what they want

[Chorus]

I just want you, yeah
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you

We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow

Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop

Boss up, settle down, got a wish list

I just want you

[Verse 2]
They want that freedom, living off the grid
They want those three dogs that they call their kids

And that good surf, no hypocrites
They want it all
They want a contract with Real Madrid

They want that spring break that was fucking lit
And then that video taken off the internet
They want it all


[Pre-Chorus]
And they should have what they want
They deserve what they want
I hope they get what they want

[Chorus]
I just want you , huh
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish list

[Bridge]
I made wishes on all of the stars
Please, God, bring me a best friend who I think is hot

I thought I had it right, once, twice, but I did not
You caught me off my guard

I hope I get what I want
'Cause I know what I want

[Chorus]
I just want you, huh
Have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
We tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow
Got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop
Boss up, settle down, got a wish list
I just want you
And we could have a couple kids, got the whole block looking like you
And we tell the world to leave us the fuck alone, and they do, wow
And now you got me dreaming 'bout a driveway with a basketball hoop

Nashville (Live/2011) Lyrics
This is a cover of Nashville by David Mead. She sang it during the Speak Now World Tour.
[Verse 1]
On a crowded highway
Through a night alone
I was barely breathing
I was crawling home
Well, it's quite not London
Or the south of France
Or an Asian Island
Or a second chance


[Chorus 1]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by


[Verse 2]
You're a distant memory
You're an exit sign
I was talking crazy
On the drivers side
And I know I hurt you
But I can't confess
Was that blood or a wine stain
On your wedding dress



[Chorus 1]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by


[Chorus 2]
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July


[Bridge]
And it's safe and warm
Where nothing ever happens
Could it be so hard
To realign a star or two
Change a southern night for you


[Chorus]
Going back to Nashville
Thinking 'bout the whole thing
Guess you gotta run sometimes
Maybe I'm a fast train
Blowin' through a valley
Watching all my life go by



[Chorus 2]
Going back to Nashville
Laughing at a bad break
What's the use of wondering why?
Maybe I'm a storm front
Blowing through a valley
Tearing up a good July


[Outro]
Going back to Nashville
I'm going back to Nashville
Going back to Naaaaahh....
Going back to Nashville

[Verse 1]
You said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""that's a lie""
Just a boy in a pickup truck
That had a funny way of getting stuck
On backroads at night


[Pre-Chorus]
I was right there beside you all summer long
Then in time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
Thanking God that you weren't here
To see me like that
In a box beneath my bed
Sits a letter that you never read
From three summers back



[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard not to find it all bittersweet
But looking back on all of that it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

[Bridge]
Been back a couple times since then
And I didn't look you up
But some trains you can't catch again
You gotta leave it as it was


[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
Hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
The one you said you liked best
Next to my old faded pair of jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
When you think Tim McGraw
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think me

I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actor starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actor starring in your bad dreams

Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do

Under My Head Lyrics
“Under My Head” is one of Taylor Swift’s unreleased songs. She sings about her infatuation with a boy she is falling in love with.
[Verse 1]
Are you trying to make me fall?
'Cause with a face like that, baby
It won't take too long
Keep on melting me with those eyes
And I think in a while I'll be hypnotized
Sitting here singing


[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head


[Verse 2]
Baby somewhere around the time
The moment I saw you
With your hair all sticking up
I was all caught up
'Cause baby you were so damn cute
I need you to need me
See the train is coming for me
Help me, save me from this crash at last

[Chorus]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, come a little closer
Oh, oh, I love you I love you
And I'm down to my last breath
Trying to get my heels back under my head



[Bridge]
Na na na na na na na na na na na
You seem to be just what I've tried to find
And your name looks so good written next to mine
Next to mine
Next to mine

Ooh, ooh, ooh, I love you I love you
Ooh, ooh I really really want you
Oh, oh I love you I love you
Oh, oh..

[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe
When you say that you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us off the road


[Chorus]
All you had to do was stay
All you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hands
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
Stay, hey
Now you say you want it back
Now it's just too late
Well, it could have been easy
All you had to do was stay


[Verse 2]
Here you are now calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been picking up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But, people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye



[Chorus]
Stay, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand
Why'd you have to go and lock me out while I let you in?
Stay, hey
Now you say you want it back
It's just too late
Well, it could have been easy
All you had to do was stay
Well, it could have been easy
All you had to do was stay
Could've been easy
All you had to do was stay
Stay, all you had to do was stay

All you had to do was stay

Never Fade Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I think you fell off of your cloud today
You didn't see it coming or did you
You tried to please everybody
But the sweet breeze swept you away


[Pre-Chorus]
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown
You think you're all alone in this place
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

[Verse 2]
Hard to breathe, nobody knows it's you
Somebody blows your candle out
You wore a mask, now that's broken too
Everybody else was everything to you


[Pre-Chorus]
The sun goes down on a good day
Tomorrow is still an unknown

You think everybody wants a fight
I think you're crazy 'cause I still love you baby

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Never fade

[Verse 3]
I think you fell out of the sky today
I think you know it's true
You've seen the world, now all you see is me
Tell me now baby what are you gonna do

[Chorus]
Oh don't fade away baby
Blowing in the wind is getting harder to do
Don't count the days as they leave you
Count them as you find a day new
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Don't fade away
Never fade"

Karma (2023) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're saying it for the thrill of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a circus acrobat
Me and karma vibе like that

[Verse 2]
Spiderboy, king of thievеs
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around


[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a circus acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

[Bridge]
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

[Breakdown]
'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me


[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a circus acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

[Outro]
Karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god (Ah)
Uh-huh, mm
Karma's a relaxing thought"

The Prophecy (Long Story Short - Live From Lyon) Lyrics
[Part I: The Prophecy]

[Verse 1]
Hand on the throttle
Thought I caught lightning in a bottle
Oh, but it's gone again
And it was written
I got cursed like Eve got bitten
Oh, was it punishment?
Pad around when I get home
Guess a lesser woman would've lost hope
A greater woman wouldn't beg
Still I looked to the sky and said

[Chorus]
""Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo the prophecy?""

[Verse 2]
Cards on the table
Mine play out like fools in a fable
Oh, it was sinking in
Slow is the quicksand
Poison blood from the wound of the pricked hand
Oh, still I dream of him


[Chorus]
Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
'Bout if they can redo the prophecy?
Oh, oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
And I sound like an infant
Feeling like the very last drops of an ink pen
A greater woman stays cool
Still I howl like a wolf at the moon
And I look unstable
Gathered with a coven 'round a sorceress' table
A greater woman has faith
But even statues crumble if they're made to wait
I'm so afraid I sealed my fate
No sign of soulmates
'Cause I'm just a paperweight in shades of greige
Spending my last coin so someone will tell me it'll be okay

[Part II: long story short]


[Verse]
Past me
I wanna tell you not to get lost in these petty things
Your nemeses
Will defeat themselves before you get the chance to swing
And he's passing by
Rare as the glimmer of a comet in the sky
And he feels like home
If the shoe fits, walk in it everywhere you go

[Chorus]
And I fell from the pedestal
Right down the rabbit hole
Long story short, it was a bad time
Pushed from the precipice
Clung to the nearest lips
Long story short, it was the wrong guy

[Post-Chorus]
Now I'm all about you
I'm all about you, ah-ah
Yeah, yeah, I'm all about you ah-ah
Yeah, yeah, oh

[Part III: The Prophecy / Long Story Short]


[Chorus]
Please
I've been on my knees
Change the prophecy
Don't want money
Just someone who wants my company
Let it once be me
Who do I have to speak to
About if they can redo the prophecy?

[Outro]
The prophecy
Long story short, it was the wrong guy
Long story short, I survived"

Look At You Like That* Lyrics
(Verse 1)
There you are
Standin' there like you don’t know what to say
And I move like this
Here I am, racing myself, I wanna know what's coming now, what a waste

(Pre-Chorus)
Well all of that time, I thought you were mine
Was I just kidding myself?
For letting it go, and loving you so, don't you dare tell me not to look at you like that

(Chorus)
Gonna look at you like that, I’m gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, I'm gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that

(Verse 2)
Won't you say, that we can still be friends
It doesn't work that way
And don't you dare think, that a pack of all my tears can take that
Crying out when I'm alone

(Pre-Chorus)
Doing right here, I'm crying right now, you can watch me crumble down, that’s for breaking my heart, so baby don’t stop, thinking you could ask me not to look at you like, that

(Chorus)
Gonna look at you like that, I'm gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it’s the last thing that I do, I'm gonna make this hard on you while I, look at you like that


(Bridge)
Don't you tell me to be strong, and make it harder than it has to be, after you don't call, and remember what you’ve done to me

(Chorus)
'Cause I'm gonna look at you like that, gonna hang my head and turn my back, to your sneak attack, and if it's the last thing that I do, after what you put me through, I'm gonna have to let you know,[???]

Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh yeah
Gonna look at you like that

Fall Back on You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Isn't it funny how many times we can say
We've drawn the line, crossed it out, turned the page
And moved on
That's what we thought
But here I am in the same old car
Having myself another same old brown-eyed thought
Uh oh, uh oh

[Pre-Chorus]
I won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road 'til the one we're on ends
And we'll tell each other things like I need you

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people you just come back to
So fall back on me
I'll fall back on you

[Verse 2]
We always let someone come in between
Talk around the truth and never say what we mean
Look at all this wasted time


[Pre-Chorus]
You won't tell nobody
I won't tell my friends
We'll just drive down this road and pray it doesn't end
And we'll tell each other things like I love you

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
I'll fall back on you

[Bridge]
Maybe we'll last
Maybe we won't
Maybe we'll stop talking and I'll haunt you like a ghost
But just maybe, you belong with me

[Chorus]
You and me
Baby this is what we do
I finally see
There are people that you come back to
So fall back on me
Baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on me
Baby, baby, I'll fall back on you
Fall back on you, ooh, ooh

Daylight (Live from Paris) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven

I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye

[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night

But now I see daylight
I only see daylight

[Verse 2]
Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
So I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town

Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now


[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night

(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight


[Bridge]
And I can still see it all in my mind
All of you, all of me intertwined
I once believed love would be black and white

But it's golden golden
And I can still see it all in my head

Back and forth from New York, sneaking in your bed
I once believed love would be burning red
But it's golden
Like daylight, like daylight
Like daylight, like daylight


[Chorus]
I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
(I can never look away)
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
(Things I'm never gonna say)
Been sleeping so long in a twenty-year dark night

(Now I'm wide awake)
But now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight


[Outro]
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go, let it go"

seven / Wildest Dreams (Spoken Word) Lyrics
If you wish to romanticize the woman I became
Then, say you'll remember me standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset
Or you could begin at the beginning
And in that case
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no othеr
And though I can't recall your face, I still got love for you
Your braids makе a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long"

Check Out This View Lyrics
“Check Out This View” is one of Taylor Swift’s unrealeased songs. She sings about a boy she’s in love with, and talks about how wonderful he makes her feel.
[Verse 1]
I don’t need a lot
But there's one thing
Love has taught me
It’s to never expect too much

Don’t need a believable touch
I just need you
I just need you
And I might, I found life
Why should we be wasting time?

[Chorus]
You don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view


[Verse 2]
Think of a quiet beach
Think of how the waves crash down
Think about a summer’s eve
No offense to them but they ain't got nothing on you

Walking with you
In the light or in the dark
Well nothing shadows who you are



[Chorus]
And you don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view


[Bridge]
I look outside the window
Everyday see something new
But all I ever wanted was a
Window looking at you, at you


[Chorus]
And you don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
You don’t know what you missed
When I look into your eyes like this
And you should be in front of me
Seeing everything to see
Looking at you
Check out this view"

this is me trying (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]

I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting

I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that

Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway


[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]

They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad

I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey


[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel
 on the one screen in my town

And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 1]
Just had a conversation with the mirror
I ended up not having much to say
Said ""Today is for the lovers and the leaders
I hate to tell you, it just ain't your day""

[Chorus]
So this is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you

[Verse 2]
And it's a complication with the voices
Rounding all around inside my mind
I used to think this heart had lots of choices
But they all lead to your doorstep every time

[Chorus]
This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
You'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you


[Bridge]
So this is my apology
My words, my tears, are all me
Laid out in front of you
Like a grasp for truth
On a Sunday afternoon
This is a song for you

[Chorus]
This is my rain song
It's cold outside and I still love you
Guess I was dead wrong
And you'll find out when there's clouds above you
Finding it ain't worth losing you
When it all comes down
It comes down to
This only rain song
You're on my mind and I still love you
Ooh
I still love you

Just A Dream Lyrics
Taylor brought Nelly onstage at a Houston date of her Speak Now Tour to perform his hit “Just A Dream.”
[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream


[Verse 1: Nelly]
I was at the top and now it's like I'm in the basement
Number one spot and now she find her a replacement
I swear now I can't take it, knowing somebody's got my baby
And now you ain't around, baby, I can't think
I should've put it down, should've got the ring
'Cause I can still feel it in the air
See her pretty face, run my fingers through her hair


[Pre-Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
My lover, my life, my shawty, my wife
She left me, I'm tied
'Cause I knew that it just ain't right


[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream



[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
When I be ridin', man, I swear I see her face at every turn
Tryna get my Usher over I can't let it burn
And I just hope she know that she's the only one I yearn for
More and more I miss her. When will I learn?
Didn't give her all my love, I guess now I got my payback
Now I'm in the club thinking all about my baby
Hey, she was so easy to love
But wait, I guess that love wasn't enough
I'm going through it every time that I'm alone
And now I'm missing, wishing she'd pick up the phone
But she made the decision that she wanted to move on
'Cause I was wrong


[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be
Open my eyes
It was only just a dream
So I travelled back down that road
Will she come back? No one knows
I realize it was only just a dream


[Bridge: Nelly
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
And now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything
Said if you ever loved somebody put your hands up
If you ever loved somebody put your hands up
Now they're gone and you're wishing you could give them everything



[Hook: Nelly and Taylor Swift]
I was thinking 'bout her, thinking 'bout me
Thinking 'bout us, what we gon' be

[Verse 1]
Knew she was a killer first time that I saw her
Wonder how many guys she had loved and left haunted
But if she's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' her for ransom, some
Some girls are tryin' too hard, she don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but she act like such a whore, so
I see nothing better, I keep her forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that she saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then she can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And she can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now

Delicate (Seeb Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back (Delicate)
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do (Delicate)
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
(Touch you like I do)
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
(Touch you like I do)


[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do? (Delicate)
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share (Delicate)
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
(Touch you like I do)
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
(Touch you like I do)


[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time

[Chorus]
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
(Touch you like I do)
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
(Touch you like I do)

[Outro]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)"

The Alchemy X Treacherous Mashup (Live From Paris) Lyrics
[Part I: The Alchemy]

[Verse 1]
This happens once every few lifetimes
These chemicals hit me like white wine
What if I told you I'm back?
The hospital was a drag
Worst sleep that I ever had
I circled you on a map
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm coming back so strong

[Chorus]
So when I touch down
Call the amateurs and cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
Who are we to fight the alchemy?

[Verse 2]
Hey, you, what if I told you we're cool?
That child's play back in school
Is forgiven under my rule
I haven't come around in so long
But I'm making a comeback to where I belong


[Chorus]
So when I

[Part II: Treacherous]

[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I-I-I like it
Like it
Like it

[Part III: The Alchemy]

[Bridge]
Shirts off and your friends lift you up over your heads
Beer stickin' to the floor, cheers chanted 'cause they said
""There was no chance trying to be the greatest in the league""
Where's the trophy? He just comes runnin' over to me


[Chorus]
Touchdown
Call the amateurs, cut 'em from the team
Ditch the clowns, get the crown
Baby, I'm the one to beat
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?
These blokes warm the benches
We've been on a winning streak
He jokes that it's heroin, but this time with an ""E""
'Cause the sign on your heart
Said it's still reserved for me
Honestly, who are we to fight the alchemy?

[Post-Chorus]
Who are we to fight the alchemy?
Who are we to fight it?
Who are we to fight the alchemy?

[Part IV: Treacherous / The Alchemy]

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you and get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

Bad Blood Lyrics
A cover of Taylor Swift’s “Bad Blood.”
[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me


[Pre-Chorus]
It's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I


[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know we used to have mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
Now we've got problems
I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood


[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Got scars on my back from your knife
Don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds, they always last
Did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
Time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming' my way
Just don't



[Pre-Chorus]
It's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I


[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
And now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood


[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, your blood runs cold


[Chorus]
And baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey"

Crazier Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door, there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was tryin' to fly, but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier

[Verse 2]
I've watched from the distance as you made lifе your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you madе it so real
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I'm, I'm lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier


[Bridge]
You showed me what livin' is for
Don't wanna hide anymore

[Chorus]
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I, am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier"

...Ready For It? Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Knew he was a dancer
 first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' it for ransom
, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a fan
, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gonna go
Know me
 and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and sunsets low
All you have to know


[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we see
, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now


[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Know me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and sunsets low
All you have to know (All you have to know)

In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we see, baby
In the middle of the night in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you

Oh, are you ready for it?

Baby, let the games begin

Spinning Around Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Days go by, I wonder if you hear me
Can't you read between the lines?
Now I'm standing still, I am disappearing
Take this chance, I'll make you mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

[Chorus]
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

[Verse 2]
He tells lies, are you really thinking
That you deserve another try

When you see these eyes
You see another planet
Don't ask how, but fate decides


[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you wonder why
You change in time
Makes you feel so empty inside

[Chorus]
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

[Bridge]
Spinning and turning
And living and learning
I should be able to handle this
Make it or break it
Move it or shake it
Do it or fake it
Girl you've got to make it

[Chorus]
But love's got me cornered in the back of the room
I'm spinning around, I'm spinning around
And all I see is someone I don't know
Love's got me tangled, tired me too
No sign of a wall, sign of wall
Spinning me around
And baby all I see is you

Picture to Burn (Alternate Version) (Rhapsody exclusive) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, I'll tell mine you're gay
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just anothеr picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no timе for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned or incase you haven't heard
You're knocking on a slammed door

You're just another picture to burn

Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn

Down Came the Rain Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Here in my mind the sky looks the same
On every day you loved me
When we started home it started to rain
You put your coat around me
We stood there in the road
You held me so close
But did you ever let go

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

[Verse 2]
In through the window I see her with you
I’m soaked to the skin, you’re warm and dry

I guess the storm is over for you
But look at the tears here in my eyes
I just stood there like a ghost
As you held her so close
And as I let you go


[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Love like this changes who you are
Every kiss you gave me is a scar
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

[Bridge]
All I need is to move on fast
But all I want is to have you back
And it just keeps falling…

[Chorus]
Down came the rain
Lightning and thunder
We tried in vain
To hold on to each other
Winds of change blew you away from me
Right here right now, I feel it on my skin
The bitter sting of what we could’ve been
Just when our love was like a burning flame
Down came the rain

Love They Haven’t Thought of Yet Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I want it all to appear before my eyes when he smiles
Maybe I'm wrong but I don't think Romeo would be my kind of guy

I want a love that's sweeter than roses
And for me this is how it's gonna be

[Chorus]
Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night

Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet


[Verse 2]
Here on the couch with a box of chocolates that I bought myself
I'll wait it out but sometimes my patience just needs a little help
It's what you get when your heartstrings are so tied
I don't regret it 'cause it needs to be perfect

[Chorus]
Like there's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And he music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet


I want my own little storybook ending
We'll make it up as we go

[Chorus]
There's a fairytale guy
And he whispers sweet lullabies
And the music plays from nowhere
As we dance in the pale moonlight
With candles and fireflies all night
Everybody thinks about love
I want love they haven't thought of yet
I want love they haven't thought of yet"

Windows down, past my street, memories start
Say it's in the past
You drive straight ahead
Thinking that I hate you now
But you still don't know what I never said

Wish I never hung up the phone like I did

Headlights pass the window pane
And I think of you
We're crooked love
In a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
Makes you wanna turn right back around

Never hung up the phone like I did
I wish that you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live

You always knew how to push my buttons
You gave me everything and nothing

Stand back where you stood
I wish you would, I wish you would

See your face, hear my voice in the dark

In a straight line down

Never hung up the phone like I did

The Life of a Showgirl (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
Her name was Kitty
Made her money being pretty and witty
They gave her the keys to this city
Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh
I bought a ticket
She's dancing in her garters and fishnets
Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
Looking back, I guess it was kismet

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I waited by the stage door, packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name, then glowing like the end of a cigarette, wow, she came out
I said, ""You're living my drеam""
Then she said to me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
""Hеy, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never, ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten, so
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna""


[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]
She was a menace
The baby of the family in Lenox
Her father whored around like all men did
Her mother took pills and played tennis

[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter & Taylor Swift]
So she waited by the stage door as the club promoter arrived
She said, ""I'd sell my soul to have a taste of a magnificent life that's all mine""
But that's not what showgirls get
They leave us for dead

[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Sabrina Carpenter & Taylor Swift]
Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never, ever gonna
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten, so
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck
I paid my dues with every bruise, I knew what to expect
Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins?
They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away
And all the headshots on the walls
Of the dance hall are of the witches
Who wish I'd hurry up and die
But I'm immortal now, baby dolls
I couldn't if I tried
So I say


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
""Thank you for the lovely bouquet
I'm married to the hustle
And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
And I'll never know another
Pain hidden by the lipstick and lace (Lipstick and lace)
Sequins are forever
And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
Wouldn't have it any other way"" (Wouldn't have it any other way)

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Oh, wouldn't have it any other way
(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Hey, Kitty
(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Now I make my money being pretty and witty
Thank you for the lovely bouquet

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
Thank you for an unforgettable night
We will see you next time
Give it up for the band
And the dancers
And of course, Sabrina
I love you, Taylor
That's our show
We love you so much
Goodnight"

Bette Davis Eyes (Live/2011) Lyrics
“Bette Davis Eyes” is a cover song from Taylor Swift’s Speak Now–World Tour Live album. The song was originally by Jackie DeShannon, and later popularized by Kim Carnes.
[Spoken Intro]
There is some unbelievable music that has come out of artists who are from LA, did you know that?
Like Los Angeles has put out so many bands and artists that I’m such a fan of and
I’d love to play you some music I’m a fan of that’s come from LA, is that okay?
This one came out in 1981: 8 years before I was born and I love this song, it’s called “Bette Davis Eyes”

[Verse 1]
Her hair is Harlow gold
Her lips sweet surprise
Her hands are never cold
She's got Bette Davis eyes

She'll turn her music on
You won't have to think twice
She's pure as New York snow
She’s got Bette Davis eyes

[Chorus 1]
And she'll tease you
She'll unease you
All the better just to please you
She's precocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush
She got Greta Garbo stand off sighs
She's got Bette Davis eyes


[Verse 2]
She'll let you take her home
It whets her appetite
She'll lay you on her throne
She’s got Bette Davis eyes


[Chorus 2]
She'll expose you
And just knows you
Off your feet with the crumbs she throws you
She's ferocious and she knows just
What it takes to make a pro blush (ayy,ayy)
All the boys think she's a spy
She's got Bette Davis eyes"

Cassandra (First Draft Phone Memo) Lyrics
Hey, I love this track so, so, so much. Um, this is either called... This is either called, um... ""Cassandra"", or... No, I think it's called that. Uh, 'cause of the Greek, uh, In Greek mythology, Cassandra was brought on by Apollo to, to, always warn people of impending doom, but she was cursed to never be listened to. So, uh, read into this what you will based on our, uh, current social and cultural climate

[Verse 1]
I was in my new house placing daydreams
Patching up the crack along the wall
I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I got the call

[Pre-Chorus]
When the first shot's fired, there's screamin'

In the street, there's a raging riot
When the ""Burn the bitch,"" they're shrieking

When the truth comes out, it's quiet

[Chorus]
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

[Verse 2]
I was in my tower weaving nightmares
Twisting all my smiles into snarls
Say, ""What doesn't kill you makes you aware""
What happens if it becomes who you are?


[Chorus]
So, they killed Cassandra first 'cause she feared the worst
And tried to tell the town
So they set my life in flames, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?

[Bridge]
They knew, they knew, they knew the whole time
That I was onto somethin'
The family, the pure greed, the Christian chorus line
They all said nothin'
Blood's thick, but nothin' like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning, no one heard

[Verse 3]
I was patching up the crack along the wall

I pass it and lose track of what I'm saying
'Cause that's where I was when I lost it all

[Chorus]
Yeah, they killed Cassandra first 'cause I feared the worst

And tried to tell the town
Yeah, they filled my cell with snakes, I regret to say
Do you believe me now?


[Post-Chorus]
Ah, ah, ah
Onto somethin'
Ah, ah, ah
They all said nothin'
'Cause blood's thick but nothin' like a payroll
Bet they never spared a prayer for my soul
You can mark my words that I said it first
In a mourning warning, no one heard
No one heard, not a single word, no one heard

[Outro]
When the first shot's fired, there's screamin'

In the street, there's a raging riot
When the ""Burn the bitch,"" they're shrieking

When the truth comes out, it's quiet
It's so quiet

Hahaha, you like it?"

ME! (feat. Brendon Urie of Panic! At The Disco) (Live From The Billboard Music Awards) Lyrics
[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie, Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company

This Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Clear blue water, high tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker, currents swept you out again
And you are just gone and gone, gone and gone
In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this


[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is back from the dead
And these hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me


[Verse 2]
Tossing, turning, struggled through the night with someone new
And I can go on and on, on and on, and I will
Lantern burning, flickering in my mind for only you
But you were still gone, gone
Been losin' grip, these sinking ships
It's like you showed up just in time


[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is back from the dead
And these hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me



[Bridge]
I kiss your cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees
When you're young, you run
When you're young, you run
When you're young, you run
But you come back to what you need


[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is back from the dead
And these hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark
These hands had to let it go free
This love came back to me
This love came back to me"

Cannonball Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift & Justin Bieber]
One thing I know, love isn't easy
But it's not this hard, yeah (Yeah)
We built this love up so high and
We shot through it like a cannonball

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I'm not here to play these games
Now our love is not the same
And I know who you are

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Bieber]
'Cause your love's like a cannonball
I don't wanna treat this love like a battle
There was a time I was on your side, but not anymore
Your love's like a cannonball
'Cause no one wins, nobody gives you a medal
And both of us will take the fall
'Cause your love's like a cannonball

[Verse 2: Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Both]
Hang up the phone, I'm getting used to it
Telling me it's all my fault when I was tryna calm you down (Down)
And I always told him, ""I don't wanna fight with you"" (Fight with you)
But it's looking like the wrong is always right with you
And baby, I don't wanna do this anymore (Anymore, anymore)
I'm not here to fight these wars
You storm off and slam the door
But I think you liked it, yeah


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Justin Bieber]
And your love's like a cannonball
I don't wanna treat this love like a battle
There was a time I was on your side, but not anymore
Your love's like a cannonball
'Cause no one wins, nobody gives you a medal
And both of us will take the fall
'Cause your love's like a cannonball

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Justin Bieber, Both]
Up and down, in and out, on and on, scream and shout
Will she stay? Will she go? With a girl like that, you never know
Next time you call, you'll hear nothing at all (A girl like a cannonball)

[Instrumental Break]

[Outro: Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift, Both]
(Got me going like a cannonball)
So far away, yeah (Yeah), away (Got me going like a cannonball)
And it's too late, yeah (Got me going like a cannonball)
I've had all I can take, yeah (Got me going like a cannonball)
And there's nothing left to say"

Made Up You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Your feet under the table
I love it when they're touching mine
Your hands make the best kind of cradle
To tell me everything is fine
All I see is you looking at me

[Chorus]
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You


[Verse 2]
You smile just like a picture
It doesn't even need a frame
Sometimes I wait to answer
Just to hear you say my name
And all I want is just what I've got

[Chorus]
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You


[Verse 3]
I'd never let you go
Even If I could
Cause I never could've dreamed you up this good

[Chorus]
Do you know when you go
You make the sweetest sight at the window
If you had never come out of the blue
I would have stayed up and Made Up You

Billboard Woman of the Decade Speech,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-billboard-woman-of-the-decade-speech-annotated,"4 Contributors
Billboard Woman of the Decade Speech Lyrics
Taylor Swift became the first ever recipient of Billboard’s “Woman of the Decade” award at the 2019 Women in Music Event on Thursday December 12 at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles.
[Jameela Jamil presents Swift with her award.]

Absolutely love this one, right? This is sort of a... it's not a short speech, so, just, I don't want this to slip and break, 'cause it's very important to me.

[Jamil takes the award from Swift to hold.]

Thank you so much. She's so supportive. We all need someone like that. I'm Taylor, good evening. I wanna first thank Billboard from the bottom of my heart for this honor, for -

[Microphone stand lowers.]

Whoa, this is going great so far. Excellent, okay. I wanna say thank you so much to Billboard for giving me this honor, for naming me as their Woman of the Decade. So, what does it mean to be the Woman of this Decade? Well, it means I've seen a lot. When this decade began, I was 20 years old, and I had put out my self-titled debut album when I was 16. And then the album that would become my breakthrough album, which was called Fearless, and I saw that there was a world of music and experience beyond country music that I was really curious about. I saw pop stations send my songs ""Love Story"" and ""You Belong With Me"" to number one for the first time.

And I saw that as a female in this industry, some people will always have slight reservations about you. Whether you deserve to be there. Whether your male producer or co-writer is the reason for your success. Or whether it was a savvy record label; it wasn't. I saw that people love to explain away a woman's success in the music industry, and I saw something in me change due to this realization. This was the decade when I became a mirror for my detractors.
 Whatever they decided I couldn't do is exactly what I did.

[Audience claps.]

Huh, I'll take it, thanks! Whatever they criticized about me became material for musical satires or inspirational anthems, and the best lyrical examples I can think of are songs like ""Mean,"" ""Shake It Off,"" and ""Blank Space.""
 Basically, if people had something to say about me, I usually said something back in my own way. And this reflex dictated more than just my lyrics. When Fearless did win Album of the Year at the Grammys, and I did become the youngest solo artist to ever win the award, with that win, came criticism and backlash in 2010 that I'd never experienced before as a young, new artist. All of a sudden, people had doubts about my singing voice. Was it strong enough? Was I a little bit pitchy?
 All of a sudden, they weren't sure if I was the one writing the songs because sometimes in the past I had had co-writers in the room.


At that time, I couldn't understand why this wave of harsh criticism had hit me so hard. I believe a popular headline back then was ""A Swift Backlash,"" which is clever, you gotta give it to them. And now I realize that this is just what happens to a woman in music if she achieves success or power beyond people's comfort level. I now have come to expect that with good news, comes some sort of pushback, but I didn't know that then.

So then, I decided that I would be the only songwriter on my third album, Speak Now,
 and that I would tour constantly, work on my vocals every day, and perfect my stamina in a live show.
 I decided I would be what they said I couldn't be. I didn't know then that, soon enough, people would decide on something else I wasn't quite doing right, and then the circle would keep going on and on, and rolling along, and I would keep accommodating, over-correcting, in an effort to appease my critics.

They're saying I'm dating too much in my twenties? Okay, I'll stop. I'll just be single... for years.
 Now they're saying my album Red is filled with too many break-up songs?
 Okay, I'll make one about moving to New York, and deciding that really my life is more fun with just my friends. Oh, they're saying my music is changing too much for me to stay in country music? Alright, okay, here's an entire genre shift, and a pop album called 1989.


[Audience cheers.]


Oh, you heard it? Sick! Now it's that I'm showing you too many pictures of me with my friends. Okay, I can stop doing that, too. Now I'm actually a calculated, manipulator rather than a smart businesswoman? Okay, I'll disappear from public view... for years. Now I'm being cast as a villain to you? Okay, here's an album called reputation and there are lots of snakes everywhere.


In the last ten years, I have watched as women in this industry are criticized, and measured up to each other, and picked at for their bodies, their romantic lives, their fashion. Or, have you ever heard someone say, about a male artist, ""I really like his songs, but I don't know what it is, there's just something about him I don't like. No! That criticism is reserved for us. But, you know, I've learned that the difference between those who can continue to create in that climate usually comes down to this: who lets that scrutiny break them, and who just keeps making art. I've watched as one of my favorite artists of this decade, Lana Del Rey, was ruthly criticized -

[Someone in the audience cheers.]

Yes! Yeah, thank you. We have similar tastes, I like it. She was ruthlessly criticized in her early career, and then slowly but surely, she turned into, in my opinion, the most influential artist in pop. Her vocal stylings, her lyrics, her aesthetics, they've been echoed and repurposed in every corner in music. And this year, her incredible album is nominated for Album of the Year at the Grammys, because she just kept making art. And that example should inspire all of us. That the only way forward, is forward motion. That we shouldn't let obstacles like criticism slow down the creative forces that drive us.

And I see that fire in the newer faces in our music industry, whose work I absolutely love. I see it in Lizzo, Rosalía, Tayla Parx, Hayley Kiyoko, King Princess
, Camila Cabello, Halsey,
 Megan Thee Stallion, Princess Nokia, Nina Nesbitt, Sigrid, Normani, H.E.R., Maggie Rogers, Becky G, Dua Lipa,
 Ella Mai, Billie Eilish, and so many other amazing women who are making music right now.

Female artists in music have dominated this decade in growth, streaming, record and ticket sales, and critical acclaim. So why are we doing so well? Because we have to grow fast, we have to work this hard, we have to prove that we deserve this, and we have to top our last achievements. Women in music, onstage, or behind the scenes, are not allowed to coast. We are held at a higher, sometimes impossible-feeling standard. And it seems that my fellow female artists have taken this challenge, and they have accepted it. It seems like the pressure that could've crushed us made us into diamonds instead. And what didn't kill us actually did make us stronger. But we need to keep advocating for women in the recording studios, behind the mixing board, in A&R meetings, because rather than fighting to be taken seriously in their fields, these women are still struggling to even have a chance to be in the room.


[Audience cheers.]

We now find ourselves fully immersed in a vast frontier that wasn't around last decade, and that is the streaming world. In music, we're always walking hand-in-hand with technology. And sometimes that is so awesome, like how now we're able to just drop a song that we made yesterday.
 I've spoken out in the past about the future of revenue flow for creators, and the songwriters and producers who are being left behind due to these rapid shifts and changes. I still don't think that record contracts or producers' agreements have fully caught up. And I hope that in the next decade, we can keep searching for the right solution for producers, songwriters, and creators. Don't you?

[Audience claps.]

Lately, there's been a new shift that has affected me personally, and that I feel is a potentially harmful force in our industry. And as your resident loud person, I feel the need to bring it up: And that is the unregulated world of private equity coming in, and buying up our music, as if it is real estate. As if it's an app, or a shoe line. This just happened to me without my approval, consultation, or consent. After I was denied the chance to purchase my music outright,
 my entire catalogue was sold to Scooter Braun's Ithaca Holdings in a deal that I'm told was funded by the Soros family, 23 Capital and the Carlyle Group.

Yet, to this day, none of these investors have ever bothered to contact me or my team directly, to perform their due diligence on their investment, on their investment in me, to ask how I might feel about the new owner of my art. The music I wrote, the videos I created, photos of me, my handwriting, my album designs. And of course, Scooter never contacted me or my team to discuss it prior to the sale, or even when it was announced.

I'm fairly certain he knew how I would feel about it, though, and let me just say that the definition of the toxic male privilege in our industry is people saying, ""But he's always been nice to me!"" when I'm raising valid concerns about artists and their right to own their music. And of course he's nice to you. If you're in this room, you have something he needs. The fact is that private equity is what enabled this man to think, according to his own social media post, that he could ""buy me,"" but I'm obviously not going willingly.

Yet, the most amazing thing was to discover that it would be the women in our industry who would have my back and show me the most vocal support at one of the most difficult times, and I will never, ever forget it. Like, ever.



[Audience laughs.]

But to conclude, I will say that in ten years, I've seen forward steps in our industry. In our awareness, our inclusion, our ability to start calling out unfairness and misconduct. I've seen the advent of social media, the way it can boost the breakthrough of emerging artists. And I've seen fans become more engaged and supportive than ever before. I've leaned on that support, and it has kept me in a place where, no matter what, I always wanted to keep making music for them.

I was up on a stage in New York City in 2014, accepting Billboard Woman of the Year, and I was talking about the future of streaming. How we needed to make sure that the female artists, writers, and producers of the next generation were protected and compensated fairly. This was before my record deal with Universal, last year, that would contractually guarantee that the artists on their roster be paid upon any sale of their Spotify shares, unrecupable. So, thank you for that.

[Audience cheers.]

This speech I'm referring to was on my 25th birthday. I'm about to turn thirty tonight, woo! But my exact quote during this speech was, ""I really just feel like we need to continue to try to offer something to a younger generation of musicians. Because somewhere, right now, your future Woman of the Year is probably sitting in a piano lesson, or in a girls' choir. And today, right now, we need to take care of her."" I've since learned that, at that exact moment, an 11-year old girl in California really was taking piano lessons, and really was in a girls' choir. And this year, she has been named Woman of the Year at the age of seventeen. Her name is Billie.


[Audience cheers.]

And those are the stories we need to think about every day as we do our jobs in this industry. The ones where people's dreams come true and they get to create music and play it for people. The ones where fans feel a connection to music that makes their day easier, makes their night more fun, makes their love feel more sacred, or their heartache feel less isolating. The ones where all of you in this room stand as an example for someone else in the next generation who loves the same thing that we love: music. And no matter what else enters the conversation, we will bring it back to music.

And as for me, lately I've been focusing less on doing what they say I can't do and more on doing whatever the hell I want. Thank you for a magnificent, happy, free, confused, sometimes lonely, but mostly golden decade.
 I'm honored to be here tonight, I feel very lucky to be with you, thank you so much."

​willow (moonlit witch version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand

Wreck my plans, that's my man


[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was onе prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus]
The morе that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man



[Bridge]
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind

They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow, and it bent right to your wind

But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark (dark)
Show me the places where the others gave you scars (scars)

Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art


[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man



[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

Elizabeth Taylor (So Glamorous Cabaret Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza Athénée
Ooh-ooh, oftentimes it doesn't feel so glamorous to be me
All the right guys promise they'd stay
Under bright lights, they withered away
But you bloomed
Portofino was on my mind (And I think you know why)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if your letters ever said, ""Goodbye""

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you
Be my NY when Hollywood hates mе
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I nеver had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you

[Post-Chorus]
Elizabeth Taylor
Do you think it's forever?

[Verse 2]
Well, hey, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?
Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust (Just kidding)
We hit the best booth at Musso and Frank's
They say I'm bad news, I just say, ""Thanks""
And you look at me like you're hypnotized
(And I think you know why)


[Pre-Chorus]
And if you ever leave me high and dry

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you

[Bridge]
All my white diamonds
 and lovers are forever

In the papers, on the screen, and in their minds

All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
Don't you ever end up anything but mine

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Do you think it's forever?
What do you think?
Ooh-ooh, be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you, ooh

Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just try your best, try everything you can
Don't you worry what they tell themselves when you're away

It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright, alright

Hey, you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own
So don't buy in love right now
Just be yourself, it doesn't matter if it's good enough for someone else

It just takes some time, little girl, you're in the middle of the ride
Everything, everything will be just fine
Everything, everything will be alright(x2)

Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head, you feel left out or looked down on
Just do your best, do everything you can

Out of the Woods Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
All seemed so simple
We were lying on the couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
We were in screaming color
I remember thinkin'


[Chorus]
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in the clear yet? Good


[Verse 2]
Lookin' at it now
Last December
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't forget, when we decided
To move the furniture just so we could dance
Like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying



[Chorus]
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in the clear yet? Good
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in the clear yet? Good


[Bridge]
I remember when you hit the brakes too soon
20 stitches in the hospital room
When you started cryin', baby I did too
When the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said I was settin' you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me


[Chorus]
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in, are we in the clear yet? Good
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we out, are we out, are we out of the woods?
Are we in, are we in, are we in the clear yet? Good. (good)"

Baby Blue Lyrics
“Baby Blue” was featured on a 2003 demo CD, which was shared by Brian Mansfield via Instagram in November 2018. As of July 2019, no audio has surfaced online.
[Verse 1]
Small town, big blue sky
Little blonde baby with starry blue eyes
Growing up fast didn’t slow her down
American child in her baby blue gown
Her bedroom was pink ‘til she turned three
She liked the feel of her baby blue sheets
Neighbors stared at the one horse lie
Of a little girl with blue on her mind

[Chorus]
Thought of green when she was feeling blue

American child in her baby blue boots
She was an archangel, sweet danger
Living and loving and singing her song
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved, she loved baby blue

[Verse 2]
Eighteen, small scene
Here, our love was a beauty unseen
Living life young, she’d never get bored
When Hank came around in his beat-up Ford
Prom night came with a blue corsage
Had the car waxed at Ben’s Garage
Told her he loved her and meant nothing less
To a baby-blonde girl in a baby blue dress
He reached over and kissed her hand
Five years later came a brand-new, baby blue wedding band


[Chorus]
She was a romantic, taking chances
Living and loving and singing her song
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved, she loved baby blue

[Verse 3]
Married two years, Hank was an engineer
She would just stay home, soon-to-be mom
Every night they’d sit on the front porch
Waiting for the brand-new, brand-new baby to come

[Chorus]
She was a newcomer, lullaby hummer
Counting her blessings and living for love
Knew what she wanted and knew what she loved
And she loved her new baby, Blue
Her brand-new baby, Blue
Her newborn baby, Blue


[Outro]
Small town, big blue sky
Little blonde baby with starry blue eyes"

Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow? Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Tonight you're mine completely
You give your love so sweetly
Tonight the light of love is in your eyes
But will you love me tomorrow? (Will you still love me baby?)
(Will you still love me baby?)

[Verse 2]
Is this a lasting treasure
Or just one moment's pleasure?
Can I believe the magic of your sigh?
Will you still love me tomorrow?

[Bridge]
Tonight with words unspoken
You say that I'm the only one
But will my heart be broken
When the night (When the night)
Meets the morning sun?

[Verse 3]
I'd like to know that your love
Is love I can bе sure of
So tell me now, and I won't ask again
Will you still lovе me tomorrow?


[Outro]
Will you still love me tomorrow? (Will you still love me baby?)
Will you still love me, will you?
Will you still love me, will you?
Will you still love me (Will you) tomorrow?"

[Verse 1]
Little girl, she looks around
She's standing in the open ground
Looks up at the girl alone singing through the microphone
Girl gives girl a little smile
And just one wink that could have run a mile
But life is full of empty days
But the little girl said, ""I'm gonna be like that someday""

[Chorus]
I, I remember the eyes
Of the kid in the crowd
Who cut me down to size
And realizing is crying out loud
For every kid on stage
There is a kid in the crowd

[Verse 2]
Girl on stage holds her hand
Backed up by a country band
Looking down with eyes of grace
Looked upon that young girl's face
And when she smiled at that eight-year-old

Endless thoughts that can never be told
Wiped away those empty days
And the little girl said, ""I'm gonna be like that someday""


[Chorus]
I, I remember the eyes
Of the kid in the crowd
Who cut me down to size
And realizing is crying out loud
For every kid on stage
There is a kid in the crowd

[Bridge]
Answered ""whys"" are like moonlit skies

And lovin' eyes are like fireflies
Wannabes, they really can be
But the little girl, that little girl was me

[Chorus]
I, I remember the time
I was a kid in the crowd
With the dream in my eyes
Realizing is crying out loud
There was a kid on stage
I was the kid in the crowd

[Outro]
Oh, oh
I'm still the kid in the crowd"

the lakes (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?

I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones


[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry

I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Verse 2]
What should be over burrowеd under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I'vе come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth


[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry

I'm setting off, but not without my muse

[Bridge]
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground

With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief


[Chorus]
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry

I'm setting off, but not without my muse

No, not without you
No, not without you"

Love Story Lyrics
[Verse 1: Yeonjun, Beomgyu]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus: Taehyun]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus: Huening Kai]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2: Soobin]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus: Yeonjun]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus: Taehyun, Yeonjun]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus: Yeonjun]
Oh, oh

[Bridge: Beomgyu, Yeonjun]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus: Soobin, Beomgyu, Huening Kai]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

Oh, oh, oh, oh

How To Save A Life Lyrics
Taylor treated Coloradan fans at the Speak Now Tour to a cover of The Fray’s “How To Save A Life.”
[Verse 1]
Step one, you say, ""We need to talk.""
He walks, you say, ""Sit down. It's just a talk.""
He smiles politely back at you
You stare politely right on through
Some sort of window to your right
As he goes left and you stay right
Between the lines of fear and blame
You begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 2]
Let him know that you know best
'Cause after all you do know best
Try to slip past his defense
Without granting innocence
Lay down a list of what is wrong
The things you've told him all along
Pray to God, he hears you
And I pray to God, he hears you


[Chorus]
And where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Verse 3]
As he begins to raise his voice
You lower yours and grant him one last choice
Drive until you lose the road
Or break with the ones you've followed
He will do one of two things
He will admit to everything
Or he'll say he's just not the same
And you'll begin to wonder why you came

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life

[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life


[Chorus]
Where did I go wrong? I lost a friend
Somewhere along in the bitterness
And I would have stayed up with you all night
Had I known how to save a life"

The Fate of Ophelia (Alone In My Tower Acoustic Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I heard you calling on the megaphone

You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me, myself, and I
Right before you lit my sky up

[Chorus]
(All that time)
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
(Late one night)
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundrеd on the land, the sea, thе sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been 'cause now, you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia


[Verse 2]
The eldest daughter of a nobleman
Ophelia lived in fantasy
But love was a cold bed full of scorpions
The venom stole her sanity

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me
I might've lingered in purgatory
You wrap around me like a chain, a crown, a vine
Pulling me into the fire

[Chorus]
(All that time)
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
(Late one night)
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now), you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia


[Bridge]
'Tis locked inside my memory
And only you possess the key
No longer drowning and deceived
All because you came for me
Locked inside my memory
And only you possess the key
No longer drowning and deceived
All because you came for me

[Chorus]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands (Your hands), your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now ('Cause now), you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia

You saved my heart from the fate of Ophelia"

It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes, uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers, uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus: All, Bradley]

We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you wanted to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're 22

It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded, too many cool kids, uh uh, uh uh

It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene and end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping

Ruin The Friendship (My Advice Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Glistening grass from September rain

Gray overpass full of neon names

And you drive
Eighty-five

Gallatin Road and the Lakeside Beach

Watching the game from your brother's Jeep

And your smile
Is miles wide


[Chorus]
And it was not an invitation
Should’ve kissed you anyway
Should've kissed you anyway
And it was not convenient, no
But your girlfriend was away
Should've kissed you anyway


[Verse 2]
Shiny wood floors underneath my feet
Disco ball makes everything look cheap

Have fun
It’s prom
Wilted corsage dangles from my wrist

Over his shoulder, I catch a glimpse
And see (Mm, mm)
You looking at me


[Chorus]
And it was not an invitation
But as the 50 Cent song played

Should've kissed you anyway
And it was not convenient, no
Would've been the best mistake

Should've kissed you anyway, hey

[Bridge]
Don't make it awkward in second period
Might piss your ex off, lately, we've been good
Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should

Don't make it awkward in second period
Might piss your ex off, lately, we’ve been good
Staying friends is safe, doesn’t mean you should

[Verse 3]
When I left school, I lost track of you
Abigail called me with the bad news

Goodbye
And we'll never know why


[Chorus]
It was not an invitation

But I flew home anyway
With so much left to say

And it was not convenient, no

But I whispered at the grave
""Should’ve kissed you anyway""

And it was not (It was not) an invitation (Invitation)
Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway)
Should've kissed you anyway, anyway
And it was not—


[Post-Chorus]
My advice is to always ruin the friendship
Better that than regret it for all time

And my advice is to always answer the question
Better that than to ask it all your life

Should've kissed you anyway

Should’ve kissed you anyway"

I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic

All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

And for a fortnight there, we were forever (Ooh)

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors (Ooh)
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her (Ooh)

All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an еndless February

I took the miraclе move-on drug, the effects were temporary (Ooh)
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater

I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you to cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighin', ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try to save you 'cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse for a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door on my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not comin' to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Verse 2]
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growing up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall


[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay away from her,"" the saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words we never heard
Just screechin' tires and true love

[Chorus]
And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not comin' to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you somethin' right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you somethin' 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

(Oh-oh-oh)
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
(Ah-ah-ah) Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
(Ah-ah-ah) Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry, and undo the destiny
(Ah-ah-ah) You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy (Joy)
(Ah-ah-ah) If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice


[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town
That I bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride
But brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out
But fuck 'em, it's over

[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun
And even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my god, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the weddin'
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

I'll tell you somethin' right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy (Joy)
He was chaos, he was revelry
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

This Here Guitar Lyrics
“This Here Guitar” is about how Taylor fell in love with her first guitar.
[Verse 1]
Walking downtown shuffling my feet
I try to dream my dreams above the concrete
Store windows traveled for miles
But something I passed really caught my eye
It was cracked down the middle, permanent scars
But I fell in love with this here guitar


[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend

This here guitar

[Verse 2]
It was my baby, anyone could see
I love the cracks, the curves, the hidden beauty
But I can't help wondering why
It came to me and where we'll say goodbye
The cracks down the middle
Can't see where they are
Since I fell in love with this here guitar


[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been
What have you seen
Who were you before you even knew me
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend

This here guitar

[Bridge]
Were you a present from a father to a son?
Did he forget you
Or just play you 'til you came undone?
Hey, did some primadonna love you
'Til she got her fame and fortune?
I won't do that to you


[Chorus]
Nice to meet you, can I teach you
All I know, can you show me what you do
Where have you been?
What have you seen?
Who were you before you even knew me?
Have you been played for endless hours
Or were you left in the corner
Or were you someone's best friend?

You're my guitar

The Sweet Escape (Live/2011) Lyrics
Taylor covered Gwen Stefani’s “The Sweet Escape” during a live performance at the Staples Center.
[Verse 1]
If I could be sweet
I would but first of all, let me say
I must apologize for acting stank and treating you this way
Cause I've been acting like sour milk all on the floor
It's like you didn't shut the refrigerator
Maybe that's the reason I've been acting so cold


[Chorus]
If I could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape


[Verse 2]
You let me drown
I'm at my lowest boiling point
Come help me out
I need to get me out of this joint
Come on, let's bounce
Counting on you to turn me around
Instead of clowning around
Let's look for some common ground
Oh baby
Times been getting a little crazy
I've been getting a little lazy
Waiting for you to come save me
I can see that you're angry
By the way that you treat me
Hopefully, you don't leave me
Wanna take you with me



[Chorus]
If I could escape
And recreate a place that's my own world
And I could be your favorite girl
Forever, perfectly together
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
If I could be sweet
Sorry, but I know I've been a real bad girl
I didn't mean for you to get hurt
Whatsoever
We can make it better
Now tell me boy now wouldn't that be sweet
Sweet escape, sweet escape"

champagne problems (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagnе problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Lovе slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems


[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's stuck in her head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems


[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems"

Intro / But Daddy I Love Him / So High School Lyrics
[Part I: Intro (My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys / loml / The Black Dog / Down Bad / But Daddy I Love Him)]

[Verse]
Ah
Ah
Ah
Woah-oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh-oh)
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second hand embarrassed?
Scream
(Bad)

[Part II: But Daddy I Love Him]

[Verse 1]
I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted


[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice


[Verse 2]
There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over

[Chorus]
And I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
He was chaos, he was revelry
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

[Outro]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not (Ah)
But you, you should see your faces
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I'm not
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah


[Part III: So High School]

[Intro]
I feel so high school, every time I look at you

[Verse]
Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand-new, full throttle
Touch me while your boys play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, Scott's honor
You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got 'er
Brand-new, full throttle

[Outro]
You already know it, babe
You already know it, babe"

I Don’t Wanna Live Forever Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Verse 2]
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?


[Chorus]
I don't wanna live (don't wanna live) forever (forever), 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (don't wanna fit) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Bridge]
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home


[Outro]
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
Until you come back home"

Wildest Dreams Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowds
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall, and handsome as well
He's so good and he knows it too well
I can see the end as it begins my one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Oh, ah)
Wildest dreams (Oh, ah)

[Verse 2]
I said no one knows just what we went through
His hands are in the air
He looks across the room
And his voice is a familiar sound, nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now


[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall, and handsome as well
He's so good and he knows it too well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams (Oh, ah)
Wildest dreams (Oh, ah)

[Bridge]
You see me in hindsight
Hanging out with you all night
Turning it down (Down)
Some day when you leave me
I bet these memories (Follow)
Follow you around
Follow you around

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just (Just pretend, just pretend)
In your wildest dreams (Oh, ah, oh oh)
Wildest dreams (Oh, ah)
In your wildest dreams (Oh, ah)
[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend


[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just (Just pretend, just pretend)
In your wildest dreams (Oh, ah, oh oh)
Wildest dreams (Oh, ah)
In your wildest dreams (Oh, ah)"

You’re Not Sorry / What Goes Around...Comes Around Lyrics
[Verse 1: You're Not Sorry]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time
And all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long baby but I figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again
But not this time around

[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no

[Verse 2: You're Not Sorry]
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you didn't leave me waiting in the cold
You've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen
'Cause it's worked each time before


[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no
You're not sorry, no

[Bridge: You're Not Sorry]
You had me crawling for you, honey
And it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Pre-Chorus: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around]
Don't wanna think about it
Don't wanna talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
I'm so confused about it 
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Won't you tell me, is this fair?

Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you go around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay, baby
'Cause in time you will find


[Chorus: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around]
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around 
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around 
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around
Comes around, comes all the way back around

[Chorus: You're Not Sorry]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, no, no
No, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no


[Outro: What Goes Around.../...Comes Around (Bridge)]
You spend your nights alone
And she never comes home
And when you call her up, all you get's a busy tone
And she's doing to you, what you did to me
A tale as old as time
Boy, you got what you deserved"

Teardrops On My Guitar (Cahill Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Intro]
Why I, why I, why I, why I

[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do... (Why I)


[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do... (Why I do)
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do... (Why I do)

[Post-Chorus]
Why I do, why I do, why I do, why…

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
Sleep tonight…
Sleep tonight…


[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do... (Why I do)

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see"

Teardrops On My Guitar (Radio Single Remix / Commentary) Lyrics
Becca: Celebration, a week of milestones. We are revisiting all of Taylor Swift's albums and celebrating their anniversaries. It's the twelfth year anniversary of Taylor Swift's debut album and we are playing all of the tracks off of her debut album, which came out October 24th, 2006. I know a lot of people could relate to this song. Taylor said, ""You know what? The guy at the time probably didn't know how I felt, but he did after this song came out.""

Taylor Swift: It's a song that I wrote about this guy who I had a big crush on, sat next to me in class, and he would come in to talk about his girlfriend every single day, and how pretty she was and how happy they were, and I never told him that I liked him, but I did write a song with his name in it, so, um, I guess the secret's out now. You know, that song is really about hiding how you really feel

Becca: Yeah, I'd say the cat was definitely out of the bag after that one. And you know, the thing about Taylor Swift's song, ""Teardrops On My Guitar,"" it was so relatable to so many people, as are so many of Taylor Swift's songs. And here it is, on Big Machine Radio"

Mean Lyrics
“Mean” is featured in Props, the twentieth episode of Season Three. It is sung by Puck (Mark Salling) and Coach Beaste (Dot-Marie Jones). The song marks the only duet between Coach Beiste and Puck.
[Verse 1: Puck]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus: Shannon]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus: Puck & Shannon, Puck]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2: Shannon, Puck & Shannon, Puck]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again


[Pre-Chorus: Puck, Puck & Shannon, Shannon]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
Cause you can't lead me down that road
You don't know what you don't know

[Chorus: Puck & Shannon, Puck]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge: Puck, Puck & Shannon, Shannon]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean

[Buildup: Puck, Puck & Shannon]
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean


[Chorus: Puck & Shannon, Shannon, Puck]
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean. Yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
(Someday, I'll be living in a big old city)
Why you gotta be so mean?
(And all you're ever gonna be is mean)
Why you gotta be so mean?
(Someday, I'll be living in a big old city)
Why you gotta be so mean?
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"

illicit affairs (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You'll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by

Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots

[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares

It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times


[Verse 2]
Leave the perfume on the shеlf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no tracе behind
Like you don't even exist
And take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high

A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times



[Chorus]
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares

They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times

[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""

Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself

I'll try to see it coming
I'll get a symphony to play that song [?] [love?]
Pick you up, take your hand, stop your crying
There's no chance you won't make it through
I'm looking out for you

Beneath those scared eyes
There's something wonderful
That you don't know you have
I know you're scared but I'd pass up a miracle
Just to hear you laugh

If you get tired of me, I'll pretend to let you go
If you need room to breathe, step back and watch you go

Sweet child, you've seen better days
But you know it's gonna be okay
Show me that smile you got from your father
It's gonna be fine just because you got my love, you got my love"

White Lie Lyrics
[Chorus]
I could say the Rosary
And pray to have you close to me
But haven't spoke to God in a while
Don't think I believe in him
'Cause baby, some might call this sin
So take me down to Hell with a smile

[Verse 1]
Maybe it's pretentious
Convoluted, but the truth is
I've been thinking
It seems the Devil's always winning
From the beginning had me on a string
Wrapped around your finger
On the trigger
Shoot me down 'cause you know you can hold me
Now you stand on a ground most holy
Maybe it's pretentious
Convoluted, but the truth is
I've been thinking
It seems the Devil's always winning

[Chorus]
I could say the Rosary
And pray to have you close to me
But haven't spoke to God in a while
Don't think I believe in him
'Cause baby, some might call this sin
So take me down to Hell with a smile


[Post-Chorus]
It's a little bigger than a white lie (yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy (yeah)
It's a little bigger than a white lie (yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy
Good guy yeah

Just because the lie's white
Doesn't sit right
Doesn't make it honest 'cause the tone's light
As I see it, here's the situation
Everyone's polite until their pushed to being brazen
Don't pretend that you're higher than Pius
In the end we all fight to be highest
Tryna stand out in my own light
But keep hearing ""You sound a bit like Tones And I
""

[Chorus]
I could say the Rosary
And pray to have you close to me
But haven't spoke to God in a while
Don't think I believe in him
'Cause baby, some might call this sin
So take me down to Hell with a smile

[Post-Chorus]
It's a little bigger than a white lie (yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy (yeah)
It's a little bigger than a white lie (yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy
Good guy yeah


[Chorus]
I could say the Rosary
And pray to have you close to me
But haven't spoke to God in a while
Don't think I believe in him
'Cause baby, some might call this sin
So take me down to Hell with a smile

It's a little bigger than a white lie (yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy (yeah)
It's a little bigger than a white lie (yeah)
Telling me you could be the good guy

​thank You aimEe / Mean - Live from London Lyrics
[Part I: thanK you aIMee]

[Verse 1]
When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forget the way you made me feel
Screams ""fuck You, aimEe"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

[Verse 2]
And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill each time that aimEе stomped across my grave
Then shе wrote headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
I dreamed that one day I could say


[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
Screamed, ""Fuck You, aimEe"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head

[Bridge]
I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
And when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you

[Verse 3]
And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day, your kid comes home singin'
A song that only us two is gonna know is about

[Part II: Mean]


[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feelin' like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be singing this song at Wembley

And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Part III: ThanK you aIMee]

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And it was all for nothin'
Screamed, ""thanK you, aIMee"" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal


[Part IV: thanK you aIMee / Mean]

[Outro]
ThanK you, aIMe
ThanK you, aIMee
Cause I'm living in a big ole city
ThanK you, aIMe
ThanK you, aIMee
I'm playing this song at Wembley

And all you're ever gonna be is mean
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"

Hopelessly Devoted To You (Olivia Newton-John) Lyrics
This is one of Taylor Swift’s unreleased songs. It is a cover of Olivia Newton-John’s “Hopelessly Devoted To You,” from the movie Grease.
[Verse 1]
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
You know I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But, baby, can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do?
I'm hopelessly devoted to you


[Chorus]
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you

[Verse 2]
My head is saying, ""Fool, forget him""
My heart is saying, ""Don't let go
Hold on till the end""
That's what I intend to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you


[Chorus]
But now there's nowhere to hide
Since you pushed my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you"

seven (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer

Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids make a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn

Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long

[Verse 2]
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why

And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates

Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on


[Bridge]
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
I, I

[Chorus]
Sweet tea in the summer

Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long"

the last great american dynasty (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city

Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí


[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""


[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green

Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach

Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything


[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
Ruining everything
A marvelous time"

[Intro]
Ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts


[Pre-Chorus]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


[Pre-Chorus]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands

I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""


[Chorus]
You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last)
(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on)

[Outro]
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it

Red (Taylor’s Version) [Prologue] Lyrics
Prologue

I’ve always said that the world is a different place for the heartbroken. It moves on a different axis, at a different speed. Time skips backwards and forwards fleetingly. The heartbroken might go through thousands of micro-emotions a day trying to figure out how to get through it without picking up the phone to hear that old familiar voice. In the land of heartbroken, moments of strength, independence, and devil-may-care rebellion are intricately woven togethеr with grief, paralyzing vulnerability and hopelеssness. Imagining your future might always take you on a detour back to the past. And this is all to say, that this is my version of Red.

Musically and lyrically, Red resembled a heartbroken person. It was all over the place, a fractured mosaic of feelings that somehow all fit together in the end. Happy, free, confused, lonely, devastated, euphoric, wild, and tortured by memories past.
 Like trying on pieces of a new life, I went into the studio and experimented with different sounds and collaborators. And I'm not sure if it was pouring my thoughts into this album, hearing thousands of your voices sing the lyrics back to me in passionate solidarity, or if it was simply time, but something was healed along the way.

Sometimes you need to talk it over (over and over and over) for it to ever really be... over. Like your friend who calls you in the middle of the night going on and on about their ex, I just couldn't stop writing. This will be the first time you hear all 30 songs that were meant to go on Red. And hey, one of them is even ten minutes long.

Sincerely,
Taylor"

Long Live Lyrics
[Verse 1: Paula Fernandes]
Lembrei desse sentimento
Gritando dentro de nós
Éramos todos meninos
Em cada um, vivia uma paixão
Como uma cena de um filme
Vencemos pesadelos enfrentando os dragões
Criados por nossos medos
Fruto da imaginação

[Pre-Chorus: Paula Fernandes]
De frente a uma nova era
Na onda de uma canção
Nós construímos história
Mente, alma e coração

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Paula Fernandes]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered""

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I passed the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there
On the side-lines, wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town


[Pre-Chorus: Paula Fernandes]
De frente a uma nova era
Na onda de uma canção
Nós construímos história
Mente, alma e coração

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Paula Fernandes]
Long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid""
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered""

[Bridge: Paula Fernandes, Taylor Swift & Both]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Lembrei do momento
Que fiz promessa pra nós dois
Pintando o nosso destino
Puro, simples, pleno e sem fim
Que fosse assim sem um goodbye
Fosse para sempre ""Eu cheguei""
Os sonhos que construímos
Me vi feliz, eu te achei
Será muito mais que achar
Será muito além de pensar
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you


[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Paula Fernandes]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
All the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid""
Singing, long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"

Guilty As Sin? (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Drownin' in the Blue Nile
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Verse 2]
I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?


[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
My bed sheets are ablaze
I've screamed his name
Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Bridge]
What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?


[Outro]
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
Am I allowed to cry?"

Fire Lyrics
“Fire” was featured on a 2003 demo CD, which was shared by Brian Mansfield via Instagram in November 2018. As of July 2019, no audio has surfaced online.
[Verse 1]
Asking you questions is like asking for lies
""Won't happen no more""
Yeah, I’ve heard that before

[Pre-Chorus]
Runnin' round in circles isn't my game
I tried to make it work but I end up getting burnt

[Chorus]
By the fire
Leading on a life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should’ve learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

[Verse 2]
Giving you answers to my trivial heart
It's hard to break the chains that I can't pull apart

[Pre-Chorus]
Runnin' round in circles ain't nobody's game
I tried to make it work but I keep up getting hurt

[Chorus]
By the fire
Leading on a life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it’s my turn
To try to put out your fire


[Bridge]
Your flames
Oh, they’re putting me out
The smoke
Can't see my way out
The heat, the heartaches, the fog, the blindness
The eyes, the cries, and shattered lies

[Chorus]
Tryna put out your fire
Leading on a life with a tear in my eye
And I know
Oh, I should’ve learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire

[Outro]
Oh, I should've learned, but I guess it's my turn
To try to put out your fire
Tryna put out your
Tryna put out your fire"

loml (Live From Paris) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Who's gonna stop us from waltzing back into rekindled flames
If we know the steps anyway?
We embroidered the memories of the time I was away
Stitching, ""We were just kids, babe""
I said, ""I don't mind, it takes time""
I thought I was better safe than starry-eyed

I felt aglow like this
Never before and never since

[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary

You and I go from one kiss to getting married
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
In your suit and tie, in the nick of time
You low-down boy, you stand-up guy

You Holy Ghost, you told me I'm the love of your life
Said I'm the love of your life
About a million times

[Verse 2]
Who's gonna tell me the truth when you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you?
When your impressionist paintings of heaven turned out to be fakes
You took me to hell too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme

But I've felt a hole like this
Never before and ever since


[Chorus]
If you know it in one glimpse, it's legendary
What we thought was for all time was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life

[Bridge]
You shit-talked me under the table
Talkin' rings and talkin' cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed
'Cause something counterfeit's dead?
It was legendary
It was momentary
It was unnecessary
Should've let it stay buried

[Chorus]
Oh, what a valiant roar
What a bland goodbye
The coward claimed he was a lion
I'm combing through the braids of lies
""I'll never leave,"" ""Never mind""
Our field of dreams engulfed in fire
Your arson's match, your somber eyes
And I'll still see it until I die
You're the loss of my life"

Last Kiss (Live/2011) Lyrics
Live version of Taylor’s song, Last Kiss, on the Speak Now World Tour.
[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me
So why did you go away?
Away


[Verse 2]
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
I ran off the plane

That July ninth

The beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt
I can still feel your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes

All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss


[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips



[Verse 3]
I still remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you kissed me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions

[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh


[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep

And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe

And I'll keep up with our old friends
Just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind



[Pre-Chorus]
So, I'll go
Sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips


[Outro]
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last"

Lose Yourself / Smile Lyrics
Yo
Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
Would you capture it or just let it slip?
Yo, his palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
The clock's run out, time's up, over—blaow!

You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
You better lose yourself in the music
The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo


You make me smile like the sun
Fall outta bed
Sing like a bird
Dizzy in my head
Spin like a record
Crazy on a Sunday night
You make me dance like a fool
Forget how to breathe
Shine like gold
Buzz like a bee
Just the thought of you can drive me wild
Oh, you make me smile"

Snow On The Beach (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but it was beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Lana Del Rey]
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched ""aurora borealis green""
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but it was beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow on the beach
Like snow, ah


[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey]
I (I) can't (Can't) speak, afraid to jinx it
I (I) don't (Don't) even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing? Can it?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Lana Del Rey, Taylor Swift]
Are we falling like snow at the beach? (Snow at the beach)
Weird, but it was beautiful
Flying in a dream (Flying in a dream)
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me (You wanting me)
Tonight feels impossible
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach (Snow on the beach)
Like snow on the beach (Flying in a dream)
Like snow on the beach (You wanting me)
Like snow, ah
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around

Like snow on the beach
(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)
(It's comin' down, it's comin' down)
Like snow on the beach

CANCELLED! (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You thought that it would be okay, at first
The situation could be saved, of course
But they'd already picked out your grave and hearse
Beware the wrath of masked crusaders

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you girlboss too close to the sun?
Did they catch you having far too much fun?
Come with me, when they see us, they'll run
Something wicked this way comes

[Chorus]
Good thing I like my friends cancelled
I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour, and poison thorny flowers
Welcome to my underworld where it gets quite dark
At least you know exactly who your friends are
They're the ones with matching scars

[Verse 2]
It's easy to love you when you're popular
The optics click, everyone prospers
But one single drop, you're off the roster
""Tone-deaf and hot, let's all just off her""


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you make a joke only a man could?
Were you just too smug for your own good?
Or bring a tiny violin to a knife fight?
Baby, that all ends tonight

[Chorus]
Good thing I like my friends cancelled (Cancelled)
I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal (Yeah)
Like my whiskey sour, and poison thorny flowers
(Honey) Welcome to my underworld, it'll break your heart
At least you know exactly who your friends are
They're the ones with matching scars

[Bridge]
They stood by me before my exoneration
They believed I was innocent
So I'm not here for judgment, no

[Verse 3]
But if you can't be good, then just be better at it
Everyone's got bodies in the attic
Or took somebody's man, we'll take you by the hand
And soon, you'll learn the art of never getting caught

[Chorus]
It's a good thing I like my friends cancelled
(You know that) I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
I like my whiskey sour, and poison thorny flowers (Ooh)
Yeah, it's a good thing I like my friends cancelled (Cancelled)
I salute you if you're much too much to handle
Like my whiskey sour (I like it), and poison thorny flowers (I love it)
Can't you see my infamy loves company?
Now they've broken you like they've broken me
But a shattered glass is a lot more sharp
And now you know exactly who your friends are (You know who we are)
We're the ones with matching scars"

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 1]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
And the autumn leaves are falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 2]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mama's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
Maybe we got lost in translation
And maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you fucked it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying there
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well


[Verse 3]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I try to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights where you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you kept my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well, too well

[Outro]
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well"

Shake It Off Lyrics
This is a cover of Taylor Swift’s “Shake It Off.” About a month before releasing the song, Ryan Adams previewed a clip of it on Instagram and Twitter.
[Verse 1]
I stay out too late, got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, that's what people say
I go on too many dates, but I can't make 'em stay
Least that's what people say, that's what people say


[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind sayin' it's gonna be alright


[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play
And the haters gonna hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
And the fakers gonna fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off


[Verse 2]
I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
That's what they don’t see, that's what they don’t see
I'm dancing on my own, I'll make up the moves as I go
And that's what they don't know, that’s what they don’t know



[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play
And the haters gonna hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off, shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break
And the fakers gonna fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake


[Outro]
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake
Shake it off, shake it off"

[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to

And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, or if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves



[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play

I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez


[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man, yeah

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
It's okay if you're mad

If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller

They'd paint me out to be bad
So, it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
You know that I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man, yeah
Yeah, I'd be the man, yeah
Oh, I'd be the man
I'd be the man


[Outro]
If I was a man
Then I'd be the man"

Bad Blood Lyrics
[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
So take a look at what you've done
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
And now it's all rusted
Did you have to hurt me when I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
So take a look at what you've done
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey


[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
I don't think I want you back in my life
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds they last and they last
Now did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
So take a look at what you've done
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey


[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix don't you know
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Ghosts)
Mhmm
If you love like that, blood runs cold

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love (Mad love)
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them (Think we can solve them)
So take a look at what you've done
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey"

mirrorball (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball

I'll show you every version of yourself tonight
I'll get you out on the floor
Shimmering beautiful
And when I break, it's in a million pieces

[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near

But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Verse 2]
I want you to know
I'm a mirrorball

I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
The masquerade revelers
Drunk as thеy watch my shattered edgеs glisten


[Chorus]
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near

But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you

[Bridge]
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns

I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still tryin' everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try

I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me

[Outro]
Because I'm a mirrorball
I'm a mirrorball

And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight"

peace (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone

Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near

And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret

The devil's in the details, but you got a friеnd in me
Would it be enough if I could nеver give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences

Sit with you in the trenches

Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother

Is it enough?
'Cause there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me


[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
And I would die for you in secret

The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?"

Opalite (Life Is A Song Acoustic Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it

""Eating out of the trash""
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, ""When you know, you know""
And, ""When you don't, you don't""

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)
Have seen it before, they'll see it again (Ha, ha)
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong

[Chorus]
But my mama told me, ""It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
And now thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""


[Verse 2]
You couldn't understand it
Why you felt alone
You were in it for real
But she was in her phone
And you were just a pose
And don't we try to love love? (Love love)
We give it all we got (Give it all we got)
You finally left the table (Uh, uh)
And what a simple thought
You're starving 'til you're not

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)
Have messed up before, they'll mess up again (Ha, ha)
Love is a song, it ends when it ends
You move on

[Chorus]
And that's when I told you, ""It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never met no one like you before
You had to make your own sunshine
And now the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""


[Bridge]
This is just
The storm inside a teacup
But shelter here with me, my love
Thunder like a drum
This life will beat you up, up, up, up
This is just
A temporary speed bump
But failure brings you freedom
And I can bring you love, love, love, love (Love)

[Chorus]
Don't you sweat it, baby, it's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Oh, so sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never met no one like you before
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

Perfect / Style Lyrics
I've got the James Dean daydream
Look in my eyes
And you get the red lips classic
Thing that I like
And when we go crashing down
We come back everytime
'Cause baby you're perfect
Baby you're perfect yeah

Midnight I come and pick you up
No headlight
Long drive
Could end and burning on flames of paradise
Fade into view
It's been awhile since I haven't heard from you
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel room
And if you like having secret little randezvous
If you wanna do the things you know that we shouldn't do

Then baby I'm perfect
Baby I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
Then baby you're perfect
Baby you're perfect
So it goes


I can't keep my wild eyes on the road
Take you home
Lights are off
She's taking off a coat
And I know you heard
That I've been out and about
With some other girl
But I can't stop thinking about you
And if you like causing trouble up in hotel room
And if you like having secret little randezvous
If you like to do the things you know That we shouldn't do

Then baby I'm perfect
Baby I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
If you like going places we can't even pronounce
And if you wanna do whatever you've been draming about
Then baby you're perfect
Baby you're perfect

Let's start right now
I've got the James Dean day dream
Looking my eyes
And you get the red lips classic
Thing that I like
And when we go crashing down
We come back everytime
'Cause baby you're perfect
Baby you're perfect yeah
But if you like causing trouble up in hotel room
And if you like having secret little randezvous
If you like to do the things you know That we shouldn't do
Then baby I'm perfect
Baby I'm perfect for you


And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like going places we can't even pronounce
And if you wanna do whatever you've been draming about
Then baby you're perfect
Baby you're perfect"

betty (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez

You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust mе
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


[Verse 2]
Bеtty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him


[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez

You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones

Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""

Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long


[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch

In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you"

Can I Go with You Lyrics
“Can I Go With You” is one of Taylor Swift’s unrealeased songs. She sings as a girl whose father is a soldier about to be sent to war. She knows he’ll be gone for a long time, and she wants to go with him.
[Verse 1]
Any day now, they're talking war
I can see the look that's in your eyes
They're not talking a week or two

Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?

[Verse 2]
You pack a suitcase, take a picture from the wall
I always knew this time would come
When I ask how long you think you're going to be
You say, this crazy world's come undone


[Verse 3]
Summer's over and leaves begin to fall
And another winter's on the way
I knew I wasn't going to take this very well
But I'd give anything to have you here today

[Verse 4]
Everyday now they're talking war
& I know this time is like it's never been before
We're not talking about a week or two

[Outro]
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?
Oh, daddy can I go with you?"

Seven [Poem] Lyrics
if you wish to romanticize the woman i became
then say you’ll remember me
standing in a nice dress
staring at the sunset
or you could begin at the beginning
and it that case
please picture me in the trees
i hit my peak at seven
feet in the swing
over the creak
i was too scared to jump in
but i was high
in the sky
with pennsylvania under me
are there still beautiful things
sweet tea in the summer
cross your heart and tеll no other
and though I can’t recall your face
i still’vе got live for you
your braids make a pattern
love you to the moon
and to saturn
passed down like folk songs
your live lasts so long"

A Little More Like You Lyrics
“A Little More Like You” was featured on a 2003 demo CD, which was shared by Brian Mansfield via Instagram in November 2018. As of October 2019, no audio has surfaced online.
[Verse 1]
Think of something you can't touch
I see angels start to blush when they look at you
When I went to my guitar to write this song I fell apart
'Cause I'm counting every second like time in a jar
And these words are just words, that's not what you are

[Chorus]
Would you rather me say what I really mean?
I love you but it won't get through if I try too hard
Honestly, what I really mean
Is I want to be a little more like you

[Verse 2]
Drag a pen across a page
Take a look at what you made- you made me, me
Turn around and watch me live
Learn again that to forgive is to believe
And to thank is to bless
I'm drawing the curtain, 'cause now I've been blessed

[Chorus]
Would you rather me say what I really mean?
I love you but it won't get through if I try too hard
Honestly, what I really mean
Is I want to be a little more like you
Yeah, I want to be a little more like you


[Bridge]
There seems to be something I can't see
That keeps you from falling apart
It's safe to say you're far away
And anybody else, oh anybody else

[Chorus]
Would you rather me say what I really mean?
I love you but it won't get through if I try too hard
Honestly, what I really mean
Is I want to be a little more like you
Yeah, I want to be a little more like you, like you
Yeah, I want to be a little more like you"

I’m Every Woman Lyrics
A cover of Chaka Khan’s track of the same name, “I’m Every Woman” was recorded as an early demo for a nineteen-year-old Taylor Swift and leaked online in 2009.
[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally


[Chorus 2]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z


[Verse 1]
I can cast a spell
See, but you can't tell
Mix a special groove
Put fire inside of you
Anytime you feel danger or fear
Then instantly
I will appear


[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally



[Chorus 2]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z


[Verse 2]
I can set your knees
Like playing unto the seas
I can make a rhyme of confusion in your mind
And when it comes down to some good old fashioned love
I got it, I got it
I got it, got it, yeah, yeah


[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally


[Chorus 2]
I'm every woman
It's all in me
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z



[Instrumental]

[Chorus 1]
I'm every woman (Every woman)
It's all in me
Anything you want done baby
I do it naturally


[Chorus 2]
Anything you want
I'm every woman
It's all in me (yeah, oh, yeah)
I can read your thoughts right now
Every one, from A to Z
Yeah, oh
I'm every woman
It's all in me"

Stay Stay Stay / Ho Hey Lyrics
[Stay Stay Stay]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn-away
But you stayed

This morning I said we should talk about it
'Cause I've read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said ""okay, let's talk""
And I said

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay

Before you I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you because you have given me no choice but to

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay
Stay, stay, stay


You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave
It's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life


[Ho Hey]
Ho, hey, ho, hey
So show your family
All the blood that I would bleed
I don't know where I belong
I don't know where I went wrong
But I can write a song

I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart 
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you
You belong with me
You're my sweetheart
I belong with you 
You belong with me
 


So please, please

[Stay Stay Stay]
Stay, stay, stay
I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay"

Cardigan / I’m With You Lyrics
[Spoken]
1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobble stones
When you are young they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young they assume you know nothing

Isn’t anyone trying to find me?
Somebody come take me home
I knew you, dancing in your Levi’s
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you, hand under my sweater, baby kiss it better
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan under someone’s bed
You put me on and said I was your favourite

It’s a damn cold night
Trying to figure out this life
Won’t you take me by the hand take me somewhere new
I don’t know who you are, but I
I’m with you, I’m with you, ooh

Why is everything so confusing?
Am I out of my mind?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobble stones
When you are young they assume you know nothing"

The Life of a Showgirl (Dressing Room Rehearsal Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]

Her name was Kitty

Made her money being pretty and witty

They gave her the keys to this city
Then they said she didn't do it legitly, oh

I bought a ticket
She's dancing in her garters and fishnets

Fifty in the cast, zero missteps
Looking back, I guess it was kismet


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I waited by the stage door, packed in with the autograph hounds
Barking her name
, then glowing like the end of a cigarette, wow, she came out
I said, ""You're living my drеam""

And she said to me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]

""Hey, thank you for thе lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
(And you're never, ever gonna)
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten, so
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
(And you're never gonna wanna"")



[Verse 2: Sabrina Carpenter]

She was a menace
The baby of the family in Lenox

Her father whored around like all men did

Her mother took pills and played tennis


[Pre-Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter & Both]
So she waited by the stage door as the club promoter arrived
She said, ""I'd sell my soul to have a taste of a magnificent life that's all mine""

But that's not what showgirls get
They leave us for dead


[Chorus: Sabrina Carpenter, Sabrina Carpenter & Taylor Swift & Taylor Swift]
Hey, thank you for the lovely bouquet
You're sweeter than a peach
But you don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
(And you're never, ever gonna)
Wait, the more you play, the more that you pay
You're softer than a kitten, so
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
(And you're never gonna wanna)

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]

I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck

I paid my dues with every bruise, I knew what to expect

Do you wanna take a skate on the ice inside my veins?
They ripped me off like false lashes and then threw me away

And all the headshots on the walls
Of the dance hall are of the bitches

Who wish I'd hurry up and die
But I'm immortal now, baby dolls
I couldn't if I tried

So I say


[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Sabrina Carpenter & Both]
""Thank you for the lovely bouquet
I'm married to the hustle

And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
(And I'll never know another)

Pain hidden by the lipstick and lace (Lipstick and lace)

Sequins
 are forever

And now I know the life of a showgirl, babe
Wouldn't have it any other way"" (Wouldn't have it any other way)

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Sabrina Carpenter]
(Wouldn't have it any other way)
Wouldn't have it any other way
(So thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Hey, Kitty (Oh)
(Thank you for the lovely bouquet)
Now I make my money being pretty and witty (Oh)
Thank you for the lovely bouquet"

[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic

But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm

Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights

Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistlеtoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tеllin' me, ""I love you""

Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true



[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm

There's a light in the barn
We'd run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah


[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)


[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
May your every wish come true
Merry Christmas"

hoax (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Intro]
One, two, one

[Verse 1]
My only one
My smoking gun

My eclipsed sun
This has broken me down
My twisted knife

My sleepless night

My winless fight
This has frozen my ground


[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason""
Your faithless love's the only hoax I believe in
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do

[Verse 2]
My best laid plan
Your sleight of hand
My barren land
I am ash from your fire

[Chorus]
Stood on the cliffside screaming, ""Give me a reason""
Your faithless love's thе only hoax I believe in
Don't want no othеr shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do


[Bridge]
You know I left a part of me back in New York

You knew the hero died so what's the movie for?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
You knew the password so I let you in the door
You knew you won so what's the point of keeping score?
You knew it still hurts underneath my scars
From when they pulled me apart
But what you did was just as dark
Darling, this was just as hard
As when they pulled me apart

[Outro]
My only one
My kingdom come undone
My broken drum
You have beaten my heart
Don't want no other shade of blue but you
No other sadness in the world would do"

Eldest Daughter (Now You’re Home Acoustic Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot

Everybody's cutthroat in the comments

Every single hot take is cold as ice

When you found me, I said I was busy
That was a lie


[Pre-Chorus]
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness

I've been dying just from trying to seem cool


[Chorus]
But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage

But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out

So many traitors

Smooth operators

But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

[Verse 2]
You know, the last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine

That was the night I fell off and broke my arm

Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion

When your first crush crushes something kind

When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie



[Pre-Chorus]
Every eldest daughter was the first lamb to the slaughter

So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire


[Chorus]
But I'm not a bad bitch (Bad bitch)
And this isn't savage (Savage)
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors (Traitors)
Smooth operators (Operators)
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

[Bridge]
We lie back
A beautiful, beautiful time-lapse
Ferris wheels, kisses, and lilacs
And things I said were dumb
'Cause I thought that I'd never find that (Find that, oh, oh)
Beautiful, beautiful life that
Shimmers that innocent light back
Like when we were young


[Pre-Chorus]
Every youngest child felt
They were raised up in the wild
But now you're home


[Chorus]
(Ah-ah) 'Cause I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
And I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow (Never gonna break that vow)
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

[Outro]
(Never gonna break that vow) Oh
I'm never gonna leave you now, now
I'm never gonna leave you now"

The Albatross (Dancing With Our Hands Tied - Live from Dublin) Lyrics
[Part I: The Albatross]

[Verse 1]
Wise men once said
""Wild winds are death to the candle""
A rose by any other name is a scandal
Cautions issued, he stood
Shooting the messengers
They tried to warn him about her

[Chorus]
Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you

[Verse 2]
Wise men once said
""One bad seed kills the garden""
""One less temptress, one less dagger to sharpen""
Locked me up in towers
But I'd visit in your dreams
They tried to warn you about me

[Chorus]
Cross your thoughtless heart
Only liquor anoints you
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you
Devils that you know
Raise worse hell than a stranger
She's the death you chose
You're in terrible danger


[Part II: Dancing With Our Hands Tied]

[Verse 1]
I, I loved you in secret
First sight, yeah, we love without reason
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how was you to know? And
My, my love had been frozen
Deep blue, but you painted me golden
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know?

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feelin'
And darlin', you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talkin', puttin' us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feelin'

[Chorus]
But we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
And I had a bad feelin'
But we were dancin'


[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swayin' as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
Kiss you as the lights went out
Swayin' as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in

[Part III: The Albatross]

[Bridge]
And when that sky rains fire on you
And you're persona non grata
I'll tell you how I've been there too
And that none of it matters

[Verse 3]
Wise men once read fake news
And they believed it
Jackals raised their hackles
You couldn't conceive it
You were sleeping soundly
When they dragged you from your bed
And I tried to warn you about them


[Chorus]
So I crossed my thoughtless heart
Spread my wings like a parachute
I'm the albatross
I swept in at the rescue
Devils that you know
Looks now more like an angel
I'm the life you chose
All this terrible danger
This terrible danger

[Part IV: Dancing With Our Hands Tied / The Albatross]

[Outro]
And we were dancin', dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
We were dancin'
Like it was the first time, first time
She's the albatross
She is here to destroy you"

All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Live on Saturday Night Live) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame


[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all


[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it"

How You Get the Girl Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Stand there like a ghost
Shakin' from the rain
She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane?""
Say it's been a long six months
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
That's how it works
That's how you get the girl


[Chorus]
Say ""I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever""
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl


[Verse 2]
Remind her how it used to be
Of pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
Tell her how you must have lost your mind
When you left her all alone and you never told her why
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl



[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I will wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl


[Bridge]
You could know that I don't wanna let you go
You could know that I don't wanna let you go
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And you say, you say you want me
And you say, you say you want me"

[Verse 1]
You turn your dial to 93.7
Broadway acts like he's 11
Self-proclaimed
Say's he's the worst mistake ever to land in Michigan
I'm just a singer of country songs
Just trying to play guitar and not do no wrong
But if you listen to just one thing I say

You should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called ""Tim McGraw""
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on
The Electric Barnyard

Daisy's from a trailer park in St. Louis
Growing up not wearing any shoes
Prettiest hillbilly girl you'll see all day
Growing up the other trailer park girls
Couldn't hide their jealousy
Because she had the only phone for miles
Now she uses it as a DJ


[Chorus]
So you should turn Z93 on
Broadway's Electric Barnyard
I sing a song called ""Tim McGraw""
Request it and they'll play it all day long
I sing in stations all day long
But there's nothing like when you're on"

Big Star (Live) Lyrics
[Intro: Kenny Chesney]
This song is about a girl who had a dream and followed it
And I know from living in this town for so many years
That there's a lot of girls out there in the audience tonight
With a lot of dreams in their head
And this song goes out to you, you alright? Here we go

[Verse 1: Kenny Chesney]
She was aware of her insecurities as she took the stage
She was convinced if she got up there
That she'd be discovered someday
So she belted it, she hit the high notes fearlessly
Oh she melted them, as she brought them to their feet

[Chorus: Kenny Chesney]
She was a big star at Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
She made the local cable shows
Where the camera fell in love with her face
After a couple of weekends
The groupies were crawling all over the place
She signed autographs like she was Garth Brooks in a skirt
And in the aftermath, that small time town was hers
She was a


[Chorus: Kenny Chesney & Taylor Swift]
Big star at Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star

[Bridge: Kenny Chesney]
She doesn't care anymore
That her high school girlfriends put her down
The only thought she entertains
Is where they are and where she is now

Everybody

[Verse 3: Taylor Swift]
Her old neighbors swear they're certain she slept her way to the top
She knows you don't get where you're going
Unless you got something they ain't got

[Pre-Chorus: Kenny Chesney & Taylor Swift]
So she sings tonight to 20,000 plus
And the young girls scream out loud for Miss Taylor Swift
Man that could be us, she was a

[Chorus: Kenny Chesney & Taylor Swift]
Big star at Banana Joe's bar
Where she sang karaoke every night
She said if you work hard to get where you are
It feels good in the hot spotlight
She was a big star


[Outro: Kenny Chesney & Taylor Swift]
Look who showed up
Happy birthday, Kenny Chesney
I love you, Nashville
We love you, thank you, Taylor"

Reputation Tour Book Intro Lyrics
Taylor included this letter to her fans in the official book for her 2018 reputation Stadium Tour.
Here's to the tour that taught me that your real friends really don't care about the ""he said/she said.""
 Here's to the moments when we've forgotten all about the things that scare us,
 the things we're insecure about, and in spite of them, we jumped around together under flashing lights, fireworks, and confetti.

To the times I learned, by watching you sing along to every song, that my greatest triumph in life has been finding the ones who like me for me. And that even in your worst times, they can see the best in you.


Here's to the musical family I get to share the stage with and all the things they've sacrificed in their lives to be able to sing, play, and dance as well as they do. Here's to our extraordinary crew and the days they spend away from the ones they love so that we can stand under the lights and play for you. Here's to the people who work at these stadiums and help clean up the glitter on the floor after the party.


Here's to getting smarter and harder in the nick of time, but still remaining delicate enough to care deeply for the ones you can trust, and brave enough to stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes.
 Here's to life teaching us lessons, and us learning, growing, dancing, and changing together. Everything I've learned about a ""reputation"" and how little it really means when defined by those who do not know you, I've learned from the fans whose spirits lit up these stadiums.


Thanks to you, I'm doing better than I ever was.


Love,
Taylor"

Taylor Swift Lyrics
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey""
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you"

Throwback Taylor Swift Medley Lyrics
Love Story
[Dani]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
[Katherine]
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""hello""
Little did I know
[Amy]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,""

You Belong With Me
[Christina]
Can't you could see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
[Lisa]
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Our Song
[Dani]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
[Amy]
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

Mean
[Lauren]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?


We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together
[Lisa]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you
[Katherine]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
[Amy]
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


I Knew You Were Trouble
[Christina]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
[Dani]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
And now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
[Lauren]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

Red
[Katherine]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met

All Too Well
[Lauren]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all too well
[Lisa]
And, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
[Christina]
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well


Red
[Lauren]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red"

invisible string (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money

[Chorus]
Time, curious time
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 2]
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer


[Chorus]
Time, mystical time
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar

Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you

[Verse 3]
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven


[Chorus]
Time, wondrous time
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And it's cool
Baby, with me
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Invisible string
Tying you to me?
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Ah-ah-ah, yeah

Anti-Hero (Country Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I have ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in a crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch you as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming

[Chorus]
And it's mе, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At tеatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced right through the heart, but never killed


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some crooked congressman?
And I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch you as you're leaving
Life will lose all of its meaning

[Chorus]
And it's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream where my daughter kills me for the money
She thinks I left her in the will
And all my family gathers 'round and then somebody screams out
""He's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Taylor performed a cover of Rihanna’s “Umbrella” on various tour dates when she was younger, including one Washington show in September 2007.
[Verse 1]
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
I may be in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always share
Because

[Chorus]
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
Under my umbrella
(Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh)
(Eh, eh, eh)

Welcome to New York Lyrics
This is a cover of Taylor Swift’s original song, “Welcome To New York.” Ryan Adams performed it on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.
[Verse 1]
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanting something more
Searching for a sound that they haven't heard before


[Chorus]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack
I can dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
They never blind me, me


[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts and put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
You can want who you want
Boys and boys, girls and girls



[Chorus]
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
Welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack
I can dance to this beat, beat
Forevermore
The lights are so bright
They never blind me, me


[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

Aahhh... Aahhh...

Down Bad (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I knew cosmic love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him


[Verse 2]
Did you take all my old clothes
Just to leave me here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you

[Pre-Chorus]
For a moment, I was heavenstruck

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)

Fuck it if I can't have him


[Bridge]
I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

Maroon (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How’d we end up on the floor, anyway?"" you say
""Your roommate's cheapest screw-top rosé, that's how""
I see you every day now

[Chorus]
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

[Verse 2]
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain’t that the way it always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up


[Chorus]
And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

[Bridge]
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real lasting legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real lasting legacy to leave

[Chorus]
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night


[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down"

Death by a Thousand Cuts (Live from Paris) Lyrics
[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up

Chandelier's still flickering here

'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now

I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
So if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?


[Chorus]
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up

Chandelier's still flickering here

'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts


[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans

My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust

Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you too much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
Get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up

Chandelier's still flickering here

'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Post-Chorus]
Part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no


[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright

AMAs Artist of the Decade Performance Lyrics
[Intro: The Man]

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man, I'd be the man, yeah
'Cause I'd be the man, I'd be the man

[Verse 1: Love Story]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello"", little did I know


[Pre-Chorus 1: Love Story]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1: Love Story]
""Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby, just say, 'Yes'""


[Verse 2: I Knew You Were Trouble]

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago

I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me

I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus 2: I Knew You Were Trouble]
And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus 2: I Knew You Were Trouble]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground


[Post-Chorus 1: I Knew You Were Trouble]
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble


[Bridge 1: I Knew You Were Trouble]
And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah

[Chorus 2: I Knew You Were Trouble]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Knew it right there, knew it right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Trouble, trouble, trouble


[Verse 3: Blank Space]

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake

Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend


[Chorus 3: Blank Space]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers

They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge 2: Blank Space]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Verse 4: Shake It Off (With Taylor Swift & Halsey)]
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say, mm, mm
That's what people say, mm, mm

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay

At least that's what people say, mm, mm
That's what people say, mm, mm


[Pre-Chorus 2: Shake It Off (Sang by Camila Cabello)]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

[Chorus 4: Shake It Off (Sang by Taylor Swift, Halsey & Camila Cabello)]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Bridge 3: Shake It Off]
Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you've been getting down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down
To this sick beat
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, ""Oh my God,"" but I'm just gonna shake

And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Why don't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh, oh, oh


[Chorus 4: Shake It Off (Sang by Taylor Swift, Halsey & Camila Cabello)]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (Haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Post-Chorus 2: Shake It Off (Sang by Taylor Swift, Halsey & Camila Cabello)]
I Shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 5: Lover]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear

Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus 5: Lover]

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and
Ah, take me out, take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover


[Bridge 4: Lover]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed, yours has been blue

All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus 5: Lover]

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, and
Take me out, take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Oh, darlin', you're my, my, my, my
Lover"

Message In A Bottle (Taylor’s Version) (Fat Max G Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin' (Waitin')
And I became hypnotized by freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied

[Pre-Chorus]
But now (now)
You're so far away and I'm down (Down)
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified-ied-ied-ied

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could bе the reason you can't sleep at night
A messagе in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

[Verse 2]
These days I'm restless
Workdays are endless, look how you made me (Made me)
But time moves faster, replaying your laughter, disaster


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause now (now)
You're so far away and I'm down (down)
Feelin' like a face in the crowd
I'm reachin' for you, terrified-ied-ied-ied, 'cause

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (It gets to you)
You could be the one that I keep, and I (I)
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (At night)
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

[Bridge]
I know-know-know that you like-like me-me
Bright-bright tongue-tied (Tongue-tied)
I know-know-know that you like-like me-me

You could be the one that I love, mm-mm
And now I'm standin' here, hopin' it gets to you

You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night (You can't sleep at night)
A message in a bottle is all I can do (Yeah, yeah)
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you (Yeah, yeah)

Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my my, look at that face

I can make a good girl bad for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
Yeah, you show me incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the queen, baby, I'm your king
Find out what you want
Be my girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
(Oh, no)

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
You can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep me second guessing, like
""Oh my my, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But I'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, you're a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But you know you love the players
And I love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

Girls only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you
Girls only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn you

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over

​betty (Live from the 2020 Academy of Country Music Awards) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez

You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust mе
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Bеtty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him


[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez

You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go straight to hell
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long


[Verse 3]
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you"

Dear John (Live From Minneapolis) Lyrics
[Intro]
Because I'm proud of it as a song, I'm going to play ""Dear John""


[Verse 1]
Long were the nights
When my days once revolved around you

Counting my footsteps
Prayin' the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losin' my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back to turn it to rain

And I lived in your chess game
But you change the rules every day

Wonderin' which version of you
I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up
And this song is to let you know why

[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I shoulda known

[Verse 2]
Well, maybe it's me and my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I'll look back and regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""



[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young to be played by
Your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I shoulda known

[Bridge]
You are an expert at ""Sorry"" and keepin' lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you run dry have tired, lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad, empty town
Oh, oh


[Chorus]
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You shoulda known


[Outro]
You shoulda known
Don't you think I was too young?
You shoulda known"

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
Bad, bad girl, shiny pearl with a price

You know that I bought it

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
It's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell her
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
We're not dying
You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying


[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
It's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell her
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you've ever heard?""
She looks up, grinnin' like a devil


[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
It's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell her
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you’ve ever heard?""
The worst thing you've ever heard
It's a cruel summer with you
With you
With you
It's a cruel summer with you
Oh-no, the worst thing you've ever heard"

Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd nеver been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you wеre trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
And now I'm lyin' on the cold, hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Oh
(Oh)


[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know he's the reason why
You're drowning, drowning, drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold, hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
(Trouble, trouble, trouble) Trouble
(Trouble, trouble, trouble)


[Bridge]
And the saddest fear comes creepin' in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, no

[Pre-Chorus]
(Trouble, trouble, trouble) Trouble, oh, no
(Trouble, trouble, trouble) Trouble

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (Trouble, trouble, trouble)
So shame on me
Flew me to places I'd never been (Trouble, trouble, trouble)
'Til you put me down, oh

I knew, I knew
I knew, baby, I knew (Trouble, trouble, trouble)

Love Story Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
You see me make my way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did you know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That I was Romeo and I was throwing pebbles
And your daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And you were crying on the staircase
Begging me, ""Please don't go""
And you said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run
I'll be the prince and you'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I snuck out to the garden to see you
And we keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while


[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause I was Romeo, you were a scarlet letter
And your daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
And you were begging me, ""Please don't go""
And you said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting; all there's left to do is run
I'll be the prince and you'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Juliet, save me, they tried to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it is real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you is fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, you said


[Breakdown]
""Romeo save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think,""
Then I kneel on the ground and pull out a ring and said

[Outro]
Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad; you'll pick out the white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""
Oh-oh, oh-oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Look What You Made Me Do Lyrics
This is a song that I loved because when I was in high school, I had problems with a classmate to the point of inventing things about me.
I don't like your little games

Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time

Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours



But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time

I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actor starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actor starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actor starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actor starring in your bad dreams
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me
I'm sorry, the old Frank can't come to the phone right now
Why? Oh, cause he's dead! (Oh)


Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do"

Clean Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst
When the flowers we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back-and-forth
You're still all over me like a wine-stained shirt I can't wear anymore
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm


[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning, gone was any trace of you
Think that I am finally clean


[Verse 2]
There was nothing left to do
When the butterflies turned to dust, covering my room
So I punched a hole in the roof
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you
The water filled my lungs, and I screamed so loud
But nobody heard a thing


[Chorus]
And the rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
That morning, gone was any trace of you
Think that I am finally clean



[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
Now I'm clean, not gonna risk it


[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
By morning, gone was any trace of you
I think that I am finally clean
It came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
By morning, gone was any trace of you
Gone was any trace of you
Gone was any trace, gone was any trace
Gone was any trace, gone was any trace
Gone was any trace, gone was any trace of you"

Drive (For Daddy Gene) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It was painted red, the stripe was white
It was 18 feet from bow to stern light
Secondhand from a dealer in Atlanta
I rode up with daddy when he went there to get her
We put on a shine, put on a motor
Built out of love, and made for the water
Ran her for years, until the transom got rotten
A piece of my childhood will never be forgotten

[Chorus]
It was just an old plywood boat
75 Johnson and an electric choke
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And I would turn her sharp
I would make it whine
He'd say, ""You can't beat the way a old wood boat rides""
Just a little lake across the Alabama line
But I was king of the ocean
When Daddy let me drive

[Verse 2]
Just an old half ton short bed Ford
My uncle bought new in '64
Daddy got it right cause the engine was smoking
A couple burnt valves and he had it going
He'd let me drive her when we haul off a load
Down a dirt strip, we'd haul trash off of Thigpen Road
I'd sit up in the seat and stretch my feet out to the pedals
Smiling like a hero who just received his medal


[Chorus]
It was just an old hand-me-down Ford
With 3 speed on the column and a dent in the door
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel and
I would press that clutch
And I would keep it right
He would say a little slower, girl
You're doing just fine
Just a dirt road with trash on each side
But I was Mario Andretti
When Daddy let me drive

[Bridge]
Soon I'll be grown up
With daughters of my own
I let them drive my old jeep
Across the pasture at our home
Maybe one day they'll reach back in their file
And pull out that old memory
And think of me and smile
And say

[Chorus]
It was just an old worn out jeep
Rusty old floor boards
Hot on my feet
A young girl, two hands on the wheel
I can't replace the way it made me feel
And he'd say
Steer it left, and turn it right
Straighten up girl now, you're doing just fine
Just a little valley by the river where we'd ride
But I was high on a mountain
When Daddy let me drive
Oh, he let me drive
Oh, he let me drive


[Outro]
It's just an old plywood boat
With a 75 johnson
And electric choke"

How Did It End? (Live from Stockholm) Lyrics
[Intro]
Uh-oh, uh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah

[Verse 1]
We hereby conduct this post-mortem

He was a hot house flower to my outdoorsman
Our maladies were such we could not cure them

And so a touch that was my birthright became foreign

[Chorus]
Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
We must know
How did it end?

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah

[Verse 2]
We were blind to unforeseen circumstances
We learned thе right steps to different dancеs

And fell victim to interlopers' glances

Lost the game of chance, what are the chances?

And, soon, they'll go home to their husbands
Smug 'cause they know they can trust him

Then feverishly calling their cousins


[Chorus]
""Guess who we ran into at the shops?
Walking in circles like she was lost
Didn't you hear? They called it all off""
One gasp and then
""How did it end?""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-woah, ooh-woah

[Bridge]
Say it once again with feeling
How the death rattle breathing
Silenced as the soul was leaving
The deflation of our dreaming

Leaving me bereft and reeling
My beloved ghost and me
Sitting in a tree
D-Y-I-N-G

[Pre-Chorus]
It's happenin' again
How did it end?
I can't pretend like I understand
How did it end?


[Chorus]
Come one, come all, it's happenin' again
The empathetic hunger descends
We'll tell no one except all of our friends
But I still don't know
How did it end?"

[Intro]
Ok, here’s the Westerly one, written in Westerly


[Verse 1]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night

Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from the look on your face
Drown in your current like a priceless wine


[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand

Wreck my plans, that's my man


[Verse 2]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind

Hеad on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you werе a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And it was only one game I'd die to win


[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man



[Spoken]
And then I was thinking like a choral section like ...


[Verse 3]
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars

Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art


[Chorus]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
Begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man



[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

​thanK you aIMee (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When I picture my hometown
There's a bronze, spray-tanned statue of you
And a plaque underneath it
That threatens to push me down the stairs at our school

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I dreamed that one day I could say

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I can't forgive the way you made me feel
Screamed, ""F- you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal

[Verse 2]
And it wasn't a fair fight
Or a clean kill each time that Aimee stomped across my grave
And then she wrote headlines
In the local paper, laughing at each baby step I'd take

[Pre-Chorus]
And it was always the same searing pain
But I prayed that one day I could say


[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, I was buildin' somethin'
And I couldn't wait to show you it was real
Screamed, ""F- you, Aimee"" to the night sky as the blood was gushin'
But I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
I pushed each boulder up the hill
Your words are still just ringing in my head, ringing in my head

[Bridge]
I wrote a thousand songs that you find uncool
I built a legacy that you can't undo
But when I count the scars, there's a moment of truth
That there wouldn't be this if there hadn't been you

[Verse 3]
And maybe you've reframed it
And in your mind, you never beat my spirit black and blue
I don't think you've changed much
And so I changed your name and any real defining clues
And one day, your kid comes home singin'
A song that only us two is gonna know is about you, 'cause

[Chorus]
All that time you were throwin' punches, it was all for nothin'
And our town, it looks so small from way up here
Screamed, ""Thank you, Aimee"" to the night sky and the stars are stunnin'
'Cause I can't forget the way you made me heal
Everyone knows that my mother is a saintly woman
But she used to say she wished that you were dead
So I pushed each boulder up that hill
Your words were still just ringin' in my head, ringin' in my head


[Outro]
Thank you, Aimee
Thank you, Aimee"

1 Day Later

[Bridge]
Is the end of all the endings?
My broken bones are mending
With all these nights we're spending
Up on your roof with a school girl crush
Drinking beer out of plastic cups
Say you fancy me, not fancy stuff
All at once, this is enough

[Chorus]
And all at once, you are the one I have been waiting for
King of my heart, body, and soul, ooh whoa

The Next Day

""Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep""
""Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep""
Yeah, thanks!
Hanging out with you guys is enough, I'm starting to do weird melody, weird harmonies
""Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep""
""Your love is, your love is,"" okay
""Your love is a secret I'm hoping, dreaming, dying to keep"""

Exile Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defendin' now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before

[Interlude]
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury


[Chorus]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

[Bridge]
So step right out
There's no amount of cryin' I can do for ya
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (Couldn't turn things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs, so many signs (You didn't even see the signs)

[Chorus]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile seein' you out, oh-oh

So I'm leavin' out the side door

You never gave a warning sign

Here You Come Again (Dolly Parton) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Here you come again
Just when I'd about to get myself together
You waltz right through the door
Just like you've done before
And wrap my heart 'round your little finger

[Verse 2]
Here you come again
Just when I'm about to make it work without you
You look into my eyes
And lie those dreamy eyes
And pretty soon I'm wonderin' how I came to doubt you

[Chorus]
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

[Verse 3]
Here you come again
Lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shakin' me up so that all I really know
Is here you come again


[Chorus]
All you got to do is smile that smile
And there go all my defenses
Just leave it up to you and in a little while
You're messin' up my mind and fillin' up my senses

[Verse 4]
Here you come again
A-lookin' better than a body has a right to
And shaking' me up so
That all I really know
Is here you come again
And here I go
And here you come again
Here I go, oh, oh
And here I go

And here you come again
And here I go, oh no

[Verse 1]
How's one to know?
I'd meet you where the spirit meets the bones
In a faith-forgotten land
In from the snow
Your touch brought forth an incandescent glow
Tarnished but so grand

[Pre-Chorus]
And the old widow goes to the stone every day
But I don't, I just sit here and wait
Grieving for the living

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you

[Verse 2]
I wish to know
The fatal flaw that makes you long to be
Magnificently cursed
He's in the room
Your opal eyes are all I wish to see
He wants what's only yours


[Chorus]
Oh, I can't
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking minе, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My housе of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered

[Verse 3]
Clover blooms in the fields
Spring breaks loose, the time is near
What would he do if he found us out?
Crescent moon, coast is clear
Spring breaks loose, but so does fear
He's gonna burn this house to the ground
How's one to know?
I'd live and die for moments that we stole
On begged and borrowed time
So tell me to run
Or dare to sit and watch what we'll become
And drink my husband's wine

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't
My pain fits in the palm of your freezing hand
Taking mine, but it's been promised to another
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered in you
And I'm covered in you


[Bridge]
So yeah, it's a fire
It's a violent blaze in the dark
And you started it
You started it
So yeah, it's a war
It's the fiercest fight of my life
And you started it
You started it

[Chorus]
Oh, I can't
Stop you putting roots in my dreamland
My house of stone, your ivy grows
And now I'm covered
In you, in you
Now I'm covered in you
In you"

Eldest Daughter (Original Songwriting Voice Memo) Lyrics
But I'll tell you something
I would come running
Never gonna let you drown
Never gonna let you drown
Na-na-na
We were singing the—the melody over different chords
I think we need to listen to our original idea and play it for Max and just kind of, like, see where he takes it
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause I think we're—
Like, I think we're—
Never gonna let you drown
Never gonna let you down
Do you just want to keep thе same chords?
Mhm
You and me, we'rе gonna stay up, baby
You and me are gonna live all night
Another ta-na
What was the melody you had, also?
I've been afflicted with a terminal uniqueness, I am
But what if you do it one time? Cause that sounded, whatever I was on to
Da da la da la da la da
Da da Like, like
Every time we're lost in the world Caught in a world we've never seen
And I have been afflicted with a terminal uniqueness. It's been fatal 30 years of fear. I'm dying just to make you think I'm cool
I am just
Never gonna let you down
Never gonna let you drown
Just stick with me [?] wanna appease you
Never gonna let you drown
Never gonna let me now
[?]

Anti-Hero (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tirеd of my scheming
(For the last time)


[Chorus]
It's mе, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Fortnight (BLOND:ISH Remix) Lyrics
[Verse: Taylor Swift]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic

All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight therе, we were forеver

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Both]
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I (Touched you), I (Touched you)
I (Touched you), I (Touched you)
I (Touched you), I (Touched you)
I (Touched you), I (Touched you)


[Bridge: Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Both]
Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Both]
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I (Touched you), I (Touched you)
I (Touched you), I (Touched you)
I (Touched you), I (Touched you)

Honey (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
You can call me ""honey"" if you want because I'm the one you want
Mm, mm

[Chorus]
When anyone called me ""sweetheart""
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the chick was telling me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong
If anyone called me ""honey""
It was standing in the bathroom, white teeth
They were saying that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home

[Post-Chorus]
But you touched my face
Redefined all of those bluеs when you say ""honey""

[Verse 1]
Summertimе spritz, pink skies
You can call me ""honey"" if you want because I'm the one you want
Wintergreen kiss, all mine
You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk
Honey, I'm home, we could play house
We can bed down, pick me up
Who's the baddest in the land? What's the plan? (What's the plan?)
You could be my forever-night stand, honey


[Chorus]
When anyone called me ""sweetheart""
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the chick was telling me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong
If anyone called me ""honey""
It was standing in the bathroom, white teeth
They were saying that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home

[Post-Chorus]
But you touched my face
Redefined all of those blues when you say—

[Verse 2]
You can call me ""honey"" if you want because I'm the one you want
I'm the one you want
You give it different meaning 'cause you mean it when you talk
Sweetie, it's yours, kicking in doors
Take it to the floor, give me more
Buy the paint in the color of your eyes (Of your eyes)
And graffiti my whole damn life, honey

[Pre-Chorus]
When anyone called me late night
He was screwing around with my mind
Asking, ""What are you wearing?"", too high
To remember in the morning
And when anyone called me ""lovely""
They were finding ways not to praise me
But you say it like you're in awe of me
And you stay until the morning
Honey


[Chorus]
When anyone called me ""sweetheart""
It was passive-aggressive at the bar
And the chick was telling me to back off
'Cause her man had looked at me wrong (He looked at me wrong)
If anyone called me ""honey"" (Ooh)
It was standing in the bathroom (Yeah), white teeth
They were saying that skirt don't fit me
And I cried the whole way home (Cried the whole way home)

But you can call me ""honey"" if you want"

All Too Well Lyrics
I walked through the door with you
The air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow, and I
Left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it
In your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition
And my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me


And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf
From that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence
And it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there, you remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there, you remember it all
It was rare, I was there, I remember it all too well"

The Story of Us Lyrics
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication, miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up I can't break through
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like its killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter
How'd we end up this way
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending, why are we pretending this is nothing
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like its killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battles in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down if you said you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like its killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate when it all broke down
The story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Now, now
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like its killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate cause we're goin' down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Irreplaceable Lyrics
Taylor performed a cover of Beyoncé’s 2006 hit at the 2007 Kat Country 103 Radio Listener Appreciation Concert.
[Intro]
To the left, to the left, everything you own in the box to the left
In the closet, that's my stuff, yes, I bought it
Please don't touch

[Verse One]
Keep talking and yes, that's fine
Could you walk and talk at the same time?
And it's my name that's on the tag
Come in with your bags, let me call you a cab

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard, telling me how I'm such a fool
How I'm never gonna find a man like you, got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you, ever for a second, get to thinking
You're irreplaceable


[Verse Two]
So, go ahead and get gone
Call up that chick and see if she's home
Oops, I bet you thought that I didn't know
What'd you think I was putting you out for?
'Cause you were untrue, hauling her around in the truck that I bought you
Baby, drop them keys, hurry up before your taxi leaves

[Pre-Chorus]
Standing in the front yard, telling me how I'm such a fool
Talking about, how I'm never gonna find a man like you
Got me twisted

[Chorus]
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you in a minute
Matter of fact, he'll be here in a minute, baby
You must not know about me
You must not know about me
I can have another you by tomorrow
So don't you, ever for a second, get to thinking

I Don’t Wanna Live Forever Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Been sitting eyes wide open
Behind these four walls
Hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like there's no point hoping at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby
I feel crazy
Up all night, all night
And every day
Give me something
Or will you say nothing?
What is happening to me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna flee wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

[Verse 2]
I'm sitting eyes wide open
I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a problem

Or just lost the love of my life, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby
I feel crazy
Up all night, all night
And every day
I gave you something
But you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna flee wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home

[Bridge]
I've been looking tired in
All the nicest places
Baby, baby
I feel crazy
Now I'm in a cab
I tell him where the place is
What is happening to me?


[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna flee wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home"

Elizabeth Taylor (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
Elizabeth Taylor
Do you think it's forever?

[Verse 1]
That view of Portofino was on my mind when you called me at the Plaza Athénée
Ooh-ooh, oftentimes it doesn't feel so glamorous to be me
All the right guys promised they'd stay
Under bright lights, they withered away
But you bloom
Portofino was on my mind (And I think you know why)

[Pre-Chorus]
And if your letters ever said, ""Goodbye""

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have— (Uh)
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you

[Verse 2]
Hey-ey, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?
Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust (Just kidding)
We hit the best booth at Musso and Frank's
They say I'm bad news, I just say, ""Thanks""
And you
Look at me like you're hypnotized, and I think you know why


[Pre-Chorus]
And if you ever leave me high and dry

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have— (Uh)
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have (Uh) you

[Post-Chorus]
Elizabeth Taylor (Oh)
Do you think it's forever? (Oh)
If I can't have you

[Bridge]
(Ah) All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
(Ah) In the papers, on the screen, and in their minds
(Ah) All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
(Ah) Don't you ever end up anything but mine

[Chorus]
I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have— (You)
Be my NY when Hollywood hates me
You're only as hot as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have— (You)


[Outro]
All my white diamonds and lovers are forever (Elizabeth Taylor)

All my white diamonds and lovers are forever
Don't you ever end up anything but mine, oh"

You Need To Calm Down (Live from Paris) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out

And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun

And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down


[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night



[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay


[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down


[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparin' all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns

You need to calm down


[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down



[Outro]
You need to just stop
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down"

mad woman (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?

Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?

They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?

Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile

Or does she mouth ""Fuck you forever""?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that

And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht

They say ""move on,"" but you know I won't

And women like hunting witches too

Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together


[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman


[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me

Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but

[Outro]
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that"

Bein’ With My Baby Lyrics
“Bein' With My Baby” was an unreleased Taylor Swift song that Shea recorded and released in 2009. The song tells a timeless tale about spending time with a lover on summer nights.
[Verse 1]
All is quiet in the world tonight
Catching stars and fireflies
The summer sings a lullaby
With just me and my baby
On the hood of his daddy's car
Pass around his old guitar
Bet mama's wondering where we are
It's just me and my baby
The world is spinning round
Cause look just what I've found

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Verse 2]
Driving home by the river side
Wishing I could slow down time
Taking pictures in my mind
Both me and my baby
The car pulls up and I'm home too late
We didn't take that interstate
Back roads was a better way
For me and my baby
The closer that we get
Oh, I can't leave yet


[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Cause nothing's quite like being with my baby

[Bridge]
Look at what we've found
So turn that car around

[Chorus]
Ooh, life's so sweet right here
Ooh, keeping it young and crazy
Ooh, just want to stay right here
Ooh, hanging with my baby
Hanging with my baby, my baby"

There’s Your Trouble (The Chicks) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Should have been different but
It wasn't different, was it
Same old story, from here's a John
 [?]
And so long
It should have fit like a glove
It should have fit like a ring
Like a diamond ring
A token of true love
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one and
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep-a holdin' on
There's your trouble

[Verse 2]
So now you're thinking 'bout
All you're missing how
Deep you're sinking and
Round and round and dragging down
Why don't you cash in your chips
Why don't you call it a loss
Not such a big loss
Chalk it up for better luck
Should have been true love
But it wasn't
It should all add up
But it doesn't


[Chorus]
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With a wrong one
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep-a holdin' on
There's your trouble

[Bridge]
Should have all worked out
But it didn't
She should be here now
But she isn't

[Chorus]
There's your trouble
There's your trouble
You keep seeing double
With the wrong one and
You can't see I love you
You can't see she doesn't
But you just keep holding on
There's your trouble
There's your trouble

The Life of a Showgirl (Original Songwriting Voice Memo / Act 2) Lyrics
[Spoken: Taylor Swift & Max Martin]
I'm recording, I'm recording
If you, if you, um
It could be an answering thing
Like, uh, we played before

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Max Martin]
You don't know the life of a showgirl, babe
And you're never gonna wanna


[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Max Martin]
[?]
Do something like
I took her pearls of wisdom, hung them from my neck
I paid my dues with every bruise, I knew what to expect
Nowadays you can skate inside the ice inside my veins
They ripped me off like false lashes and threw me away
And all thе headshots on the walls
Of the dancе hall are of the bitches
Who wish I'd hurry up and die
But honey, I'm immortal now
I couldn't if I tried

[Spoken: Taylor Swift, Shellback & Max Martin]
Something, I don't know, you know what I mean?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
May-may-maybe, okay, sorry
It should be fluent
Li-li-like
I love what you did though
I have it"

Forever Winter (Demo) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, ""Why fall in love, just so you can watch it go away?""
He spends most of his nights wishing it was how it used to be
He spends most of his flights getting pulled down by gravity

[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 3AM, pacing
He says, ""It's not just a phase I'm in""
My voice comes out begging

[Chorus]
All this time, I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forevеr
Forever winter if you go, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
Hе seems fine most of the time
Forcing smiles and never minds
His laugh is a symphony
When the lights go out, it's hard to breathe
I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head
Live my life scared to death, he'll decide to leave instead


[Pre-Chorus]
I call, just checking up on him
He's up, 5AM, wasted
Long gone, not even listening
My voice comes out screaming

[Chorus]
All this time, I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren't around
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go, oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh

[Bridge]
If I was standing there in your apartment
I'd take that bomb in your head and disarm it
I'd say I love you even at your darkest and
Please don't go, woah-oh-oh

[Breakdown]
I didn't know
You were breaking down
I'd fall to pieces on the floor
If you weren’t around


[Chorus]
Too young to know it gets better
I'll be summer sun for you forever
Forever winter if you go
Woah-oh-oh

[Post-Chorus]
I'll be your summer sun forever
At 3 AM, pacing
All this time I didn't know
At 5 AM, wasted
I'd be in pieces on the floor
Forever winter if you go, oh-oh-oh

[Outro]
He says he doesn't believe anything much he hears these days
He says, ""Why fall in love""
I say, ""'cause I won't go away"""

Mine Lyrics
[Intro]
Na, na, na, ya, ya, la-la-la-la
La-la, la, la
Yeah

[Verse 1]
You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bothered with love if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
Yeah, as we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see it now

[Chorus]
I remember, we were sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
Made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Yeah, that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward and we're taking on the world together
There's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and I figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


[Pre-Chorus]
But we got bills to pay
And we got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yeah, yeah, this is what I—
(I keep messing up, go again)
This is what I thought about

[Chorus]
I remember, we were sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
Made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
I remember, we were sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
Made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
That's ever been mine

[Bridge]
I remember that fight, 2:30 A.M
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
And you ran out crying and I followed you out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""


[Pre-Chorus]
I said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine""

[Chorus]
I remember, we were sittin' there by the water
You put your arm around me for the first time
Made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine"

Anti-Hero (Mixed) [Jan 2023] Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees


[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agr-)"

Haunted (Acoustic) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You and I walk a fragile line

I have known it all this time
But I never thought I'd live to see it break
It's getting dark and it's all too quiet
And I can't trust anything now
And it's coming over you like it's all a big mistake

[Pre-Chorus]
Woah, holding my breath
Won't lose you again
Something's made your eyes go cold

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenevеr you're gone

Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Verse 2]
Stood thеre and watched you walk away (Walk away)
From everything we had
But I still mean every word I said to you
He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh-woah, holding my breath
Won't see you again
Something keeps me holding onto nothing

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
You're all I wanted
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
Can't turn back now, I'm haunted

[Bridge]
I know, I know
I just know
You're not gone
You can't be gone, no

[Chorus]
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Something's gone terribly wrong
Won't finish what you started
Come on, come on, don't leave me like this
I thought I had you figured out
Can't breathe whenever you're gone
I can't go back, I'm haunted

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
You and I walk a fragile line
I have known it all this time
Never ever thought I'd see it break
Never thought I'd see it"

Is It Over Now? Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)
With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)
I was all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go

[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters
You dream of my face before I called you a lying traitor
You search in every stranger's smile for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when they sat down down on your couch?
Was it over when they walked up to my house?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you wеnt out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Verse 2]
Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red heart, white snow (Uh-huh)
Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)
Your new girl is my clone

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout the other time
And the whispered sighs
Oh no, I think about fallin'
Off of very tall somethings
Just to see you come runnin'
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no


[Pre-Chorus]
Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)
You dream of my face before I called you a lying traitor
You search in every stranger's smile for somethin' greater, baby

[Chorus]
Was it over when they sat down down on your couch?
Was it over when they walked up to my house?
""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you went out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

[Post-Chorus]
Uh-huh
Uh-huh

[Bridge]
And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights
At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight
Only rumors 'bout the other times
And the whispered sighs
Oh no, I think about fallin'
Off of very tall somethings

Just to see you come runnin' (Runnin')
And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no


[Outro]
(Flashin' lights, oh, no, oh)
Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later (Oh)
(Flashin' lights) I was hoping you'd be there (Oh)
And say the one thing (Oh, no)
I've been wanting (Oh, no)
But no"

Dancing In The Dark / Livin’ On A Prayer Lyrics
At the first Speak Now Tour stop at the Prudential Center in New Jersey, Taylor performed a mashup cover of two songs by NJ’s finest.
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark


We've gotta hold on to what we've got
It doesn't make a difference if we make it or not
We've got each other and that's a lot
For love we'll give it a shot

Whoa, we're half way there
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Take my hand and we'll make it, I swear
Whoa, livin' on a prayer
Livin' on a prayer"

Delicate (Sawyr and Ryan Tedder Mix) Lyrics
[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I like you
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you
We can't make any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?


[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, I want you
We can't make any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate, delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate? (Yeah, I want you)

ME! (Live from Paris) Lyrics
[Intro]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of guy the ladies want

(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I'm a psycho on the phone
Never leave well enough alone

And trouble's gonna follow where I go

(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover

I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


[Verse 2]
I know I tend to make it about me

I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name

Never wanna see you walk away

(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover

I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge]
Hey kids (Spelling is fun)
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
I promise that you'll never find another like


[Chorus]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

22 Lyrics
This is Alex Goot, Kurt Hugo Schneider, Against the Current, King The Kid, and Sam Tsui’s cover of the original “22” by Taylor Swift.
[Verse 1: Alex Goot]
It feels like a perfect night to dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our ex's (oh oh oh oh)
It feels like a perfect night for breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers (oh oh oh oh)
Yeah! We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time (oh oh)

[Chours: Alex Goot, Chrissy Costanza & both]
I don't know about you but I'm feelin 22
Everything will be alright if you'll keep me next to you
But you don't know about me
But I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22 (oh oh)
Yea, 22 (oh oh)

[Verse 2: Sam Tsui]
It seems like one of those nights this place is too crowded
Too many cool kids (woa oh)
It seems like one of those nights we ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming instead of sleeping
Yea! We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh yea
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time (oh oh)


[Chours: Chrissy Costanza & Sam Tsui]
I don't know about you but I'm feelin 22
Everything will be alright if you'll keep me next to you
But you don't know about me
But I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're…
22 (oh oh)
22 (oh oh)

[Bridge: King The Kid]
It feels like one of those nights (we ditch the whole scene)
It feels like one of those nights (we won't be sleepin)
It feels like one of those nights (you look like bad news)
I gotta have you, I gotta have you

[Chours: Alex Goot & Sam Tsui]
I don't know about you but I'm feelin 22
Everything will be alright if you'll keep me next to you
But you don't know about me
But I bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're…
22 (oh oh)
22 (oh oh)

[Outro]
It feels like one of those nights
It feels like one of those nights
It feels like one of those nights (we ditch the whole scene)
It feels like one of those nights (we won't be sleepin)
It feels like one of those nights (you look like bad news)

epiphany (the long pond studio sessions) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
Crawling up the beaches now
""Sir, I think he's bleeding out""
And some things you just can't speak about

[Chorus]
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out

[Verse 2]
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
""Doc, I think she's crashing out""
And some things you just can't speak about

[Bridge]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sеnse of what you've seen

[Chorus]
With you I servе, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out


[Outro]
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen

Lover (Live from Paris) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear

Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Take me out, take me home

You're my, my, my, my lover


[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call

And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you

I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all


[Chorus]

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Take me out, take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my lover



[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand

I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue

All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me

And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]

Can I go where you go?

Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah

Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)

You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"

Yeah, just so we get the front now, we were skipping one round, sorta thing

It's a good thing I like my friends cancelled
I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Like my whiskey sour
La-lan turn by the hour
And la-ta-ta in wonderworld
They did something sour
Down-druh sour
Never got so dark, but you, now you know who your friends are

[Spoken: Taylor Swift, Max Martin]
That's where it starts over, right?
So what are we saying?
I kinda wanna do—
No

Welcome to my underworld

Can I—Yeah
Okay, yeah, I lovе that
Alright
So, just so we know, what happens after ""Like my whiskey sour?""

And dun-dun-dowda flowers
Welcome to my underworld
Yes, it does get dark
Now

No, do the whole thing
Okay

Good thing I like my whiskey sour
My lost and thorny flowers
Welcome to my underworld
With the best bad scars

Who your friends are
It's the one with matching scars

I think we need to fix the chords there in the end to make it—
Figure out—
Well, we like the ""Like my whiskey sour and da-da-da,"" I like that
Welcome to my—

What are you playing?
So
Like my whiskey sour
Da-da-da-ah
Welcome to my—
I do love that chord, to go to eventually, to resolve it
Let's do it
Welcome to my, um—
Go, so the first chord of the chorus
Welcome to my—
Uh, from the uh—
Underworld
So the first one is
Cancelled
What was that? Uh
What was the cancelled? I like my
I actually think we need to go back to that first chord of the entire song
With the underworld
Yeah, uh-huh


[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Good thing, good thing, good
Said I like my friends cancelled
I like 'em cloaked in Gucci and in scandal
Now you're turning sour
Like bark and thorny flowers
Welcome to my underworld
We're the fancy side
It's so funny, 'cause it gets quite dark
Your friends are
Like
Welcome to my underworld
Da-da-da, dark
Na-na-na, you know

[Spoken: Taylor Swift, Max Martin]
You know what I mean, like?
Welcome to my underworld, like, it gets quite dark
But at least you know who your friends are
But is that—
Are you saying that's the end of the hook?
Kind of, like, welcome to my underworld, yes, it gets quite dark
The water's not fine, it's got tons of, loads of sharks
Like, welcome to my underworld
Like, you know what I mean? Like, we'll figure out what to do there
At least you know who your friends are
They're the ones with matching scars"

Fearless (Taylor’s Version) [Announcement & Liner Notes] Lyrics
When I think back on the Fearless album and all that you turned it into, a completely involuntary smile creeps across my face. This was the musical era in which so many inside jokes were created between us, so many hugs exchanged and hands touched, so many unbreakable bonds formed. So before I say anything else, let me just say that it was a real honor to get to be a teenager alongside you. and for those of you I've come to know more recently than 2008, I am ecstatic that I'll get to experience a bit of that feeling with you in the very near future. Now that I can fully appreciate it in its whimsical, effervescent, chaotic entirety.

Fearless was an album full of magic and curiosity, the bliss and devastation of youth. It was the diary of the adventures and explorations of a teenage girl who was learning tiny lessons with every new crack in the facade of the fairytale ending she'd been shown in the movies. I'm thrilled to tell you that my new version of Fearless is done and will be with you soon it's called Fearless (Taylor's Version) and it includes 26 songs.

I've spoken a lot about why i'm remaking my first six albums, but the way I've chosen to do this will hopefully help illuminate where I'm coming from. artists should own their own work for so many reasons, but the most screamingly obvious one is that the artist is the only one who really *knows* that body of work. For example, only I know which songs I wrote that almost made the Fearless album. Songs I absolutely adored, but were held back for different reasons (don't want too many breakup songs, don't want too many down tempo songs, can't fit that many songs on a physical CD).

Those reasons seem unnecessary now. I've decIded I want you to have the whole story, see the entire vivid picture and let you into the entire dreamscape that is my Fearless album. That's why I've chosen to include 6 never before released songs on my version of this album. Written when I was between the ages 16 and 18, these were the ones it killed me to leave behind.

This process has been more fulfilling and emotional than I could've imagined and has made me even more determined to re-record all of my music. I hope you'll like this first outing as much as I liked traveling back in time to recreate it.
Love Story (Taylor's Version) will be out tonight.

Sincerely and fearlessly,
Taylor"

Taylor Swift Responds To Kanye’s ‘Famous’ Lyric Lyrics
Search


Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch’ in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened
. You don't get to control someone’s emotional response to being called ‘that bitch’ in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did.
 While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve’ a song you haven’t heard. Being falsely painted as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009."

End Game Lyrics
[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ahh
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (yeah)
You like the bad ones, too

[Verse 1]
Now well when I was young, we connected
When we were a little bit older, both done
I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me and rumours are knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
I made some mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm something was born on the Fourth of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, never say it


[Pre-Chorus]
I don't lose you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love, you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Walking on the beach with you right next to me
I know what they all say, yeah
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (wanna' be your first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ahh
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies (yeah)
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah (git, git)
And I heard about you, ooh (yeah)
You like the bad ones, too


[Verse 3]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I buried hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your handprints on my soul
It's like your eyes are bigger, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my own lips

[Chorus]
I wanna be your end game (end game)
I wanna be your first string (me and you)
I wanna be your A-Team (be your A-Team now)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (oh, I do)
I wanna be your first string (first string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game"

Picture To Burn (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
Therе's no time for tears
I'm just sitting herе planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn"

Peter (Live From Stockholm) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Forgive me Peter, my lost fearless leader
In closets like Cedar, preserved from when we were just kids
Is it something I did?
The goddess of timing once found us beguiling
She said she was trying, Peter, was she lying?
My ribs get the feeling she did

[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna come down
We said it was just goodbye for now

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you werе gonna grow up
Then you were gonna comе find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes, promises oceans deep
But never to keep

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, never to keep

[Verse 2]
Are you still a mind-reader, a natural scene-stealer?
I've heard great things Peter, but life was always easier on you
Than it was on me
And sometimes it gets me, when crossing your jet stream
We both did the best we could do underneath the same moon
In different galaxies


[Pre-Chorus]
And I didn't wanna hang around
I thought it was just goodbye for now

[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes, promises oceans deep
But never to keep

[Post-Chorus]
But never to keep

[Bridge]
And I won't confess that I waited, but I let the lamp burn
As the men masqueraded, I hoped you return
With your feet on the ground, tell me all that you've learned
'Cause love's never lost if perspective is earned
And you said you'd come and get me, but you were twenty-five
And the shelf life of those fantasies has expired
Lost to the lost boys, chapter of your life
Forgive me Peter, please know I that I tried to
Hold on to the days when you were mine
But the woman who sits by the window has turned out the light


[Chorus]
You said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Said you were gonna grow up
Then you were gonna come find me
Words from the mouths of babes, promises oceans deep
But never to keep"

Teardrops On My Guitar (Acoustic) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bet she's beautiful
That girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love
He's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do


[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus]
She'd better hold him tight
Give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone
As I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough for me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing
Don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into

The Archer (Live from Paris) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies

I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you


[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?

And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years


[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost

The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone

Help me hold on to you


[Chorus]
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)


[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me


[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer
I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

But who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay

Opalite (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I had a bad habit
Of missing lovers past
My brother used to call it

""Eating out of the trash""
It's never gonna last
I thought my house was haunted
I used to live with ghosts
And all the perfect couples
Said, ""When you know, you know""
And, ""When you don't, you don't""

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)
Have seen it before, they'll see it again (Ha, ha)
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
I was wrong

[Chorus]
But my mama told me, ""It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you bеfore
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, thе sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""


[Verse 2]
You couldn't understand it
Why you felt alone
You were in it for real
She was in her phone
And you were just a pose
And don't we try to love love? (Love love)
We give it all we got (Give it all we got)
You finally left the table (Uh, uh)
And what a simple thought
You're starving 'til you're not

[Pre-Chorus]
And all of the foes, and all of the friends (Ha, ha)
Have messed up before, they'll mess up again (Ha, ha)
Life is a song, it ends when it ends
You move on

[Chorus]
And that's when I told you, ""It's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you before
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh""


[Bridge]
This is just
A storm inside a teacup
But shelter here with me, my love
Thunder like a drum
This life will beat you up, up, up, up
This is just
A temporary speed bump
But failure brings you freedom
And I can bring you love, love, love, love (Love)

[Chorus]
Don't you sweat it, baby, it's alright
You were dancing through the lightning strikes
Oh, so sleepless in the onyx night
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, my Lord
Never made no one like you before (No)
You had to make your own sunshine
But now, the sky is opalite, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh, oh"

Renegade (Pop Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
And if I would've known how many pieces you had crumbled into
I might have let them lay

[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way; open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be thе first renegade to need somеbody
Is it insensitive for me to say, ""Get your shit together so I can love you?""
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
You fire off missiles 'cause you hate yourself
But do you know you're demolishing me?
And then you squeeze my hand as I'm about to leave


[Chorus: Taylor Swift with Justin Vernon]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way; open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it insensitive for me to say, ""Get your shit together so I can love you?""
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
And if I would've known
How sharp the pieces were you'd crumbled into
I might've let them lay

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way; open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Justin Vernon]
To need somebody, to need somebody, to need somebody, to need
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
Is it insensitive for me to say, ""Get your shit together so I can love you?""
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it really your anxiety that stops you from giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?"

Last Kiss (Live From Kansas City) Lyrics
[Intro]
It's time to play ""Last Kiss"" and cry

[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?

Away
I still remember, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
Never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips


[Verse 2]
I still remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showin' off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancin', but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake meetin' my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions


[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, mmm


[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep

And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

[Verse 3]
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind


[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll go
Sit on the floor wearin' your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be somethin' you miss


[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips


[Outro]
Just like our last kiss
'Ever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last"

Guilty as Sin? (Live from Stockholm) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Drowning in the Blue Nile, he sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep, this cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?

[Pre-Chorus]
I dream of cracking locks, throwing my life to the wolves
Or the ocean rocks, crashin' into him tonight
He's a paradox, I'm seeing visions
Am I bad, or mad, or wise?

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""Mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and falling back into the hedge-maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touching his skin, how can I be guilty as sin?

[Verse 2]
I keep these longings locked
In lowercase inside a vault
Someone told me ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""


[Pre-Chorus]
These fatal fantasies, giving way to labored breath
Taking all of me, we've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe, why does it feel like a vow
We'll both uphold somehow?

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""Mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and falling back into the hedge-maze
Oh, what a way to die
My bedsheets are ablaze, I screamed his name
Building up like waves, crashing over my grave
Without ever touching his skin, how can I be guilty as sin?

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me away
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me
Religiously

[Chorus]
What if he's written ""Mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and falling back into the hedge-maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touching his skin, how can I be guilty as sin?


[Outro]
He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
Am I allowed to cry?"

The only kinda girl they see
Is a one-night or a wife

They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)

[Narrator]
Your reuse of Lumpy's content is clever, but did you get permission for it?


[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
I'm in the business of misery, let's take it from the top
She's got a body like an hourglass, it's ticking like a clock
It's a matter of time before we all run out
When I thought he was mine, she caught him by the mouth
I waited eight long months, she finally set him free
I told him I couldn't lie, he was the only one for me
Two weeks and we caught on fire
She's got it out for me, but I wear the biggest smile

[Chorus 1: Hayley Williams, Olivia Rodrigo, Aisha, Taylor Swift]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa-
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I can’t wait to
Catch up
Before the sun sleeps
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
I'm The Disaster of Passion ('Cause God it just feels so)
Getting back together (It just feels so good)


[Verse 2: Jimmy Urine, Robert Plant]
The bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal (Ahh! Ahh!)
With the bass, the rock, the mic, the treble
I like my coffee black just like my metal (Ahh! Ahh!)
Cause I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute, minute, in a fuckin' minute
I can't wait for you to lock me up
In a minute, minute, in a second

[Chorus 2: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt, Hayley Williams, Aisha, Johnny Gioeli]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me (Non-stop love song)
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating (You're crushing in your thirties, crushing in your thirties)
Sometimes I wish someone out there would find me (But I got him where I wanted him now)
'Till then I walk alone (I'm the Disaster of Passion)

[Post-Chorus: Johnny Gioeli, Robert Plant, Taylor Swift]
Crushing in your thirties, crushing in your thirties
Ahh! Ahh!
Ahh! Ahh!
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Ahh! Ahh!)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Ahh! Ahh!)

[Bridge: Olivia Rodrigo]
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all


[Chorus 3a: Hayley Williams, Olivia Rodrigo, BigGayRapper]
Whoa, I never meant to brag
But I got him where I want him now
Whoa-
Good for you
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn SUSSYopath

[Chorus 3b: Billie Joe Armstrong & Mike Dirnt, (Olivia Rodrigo), Aisha, Taylor Swift, Johnny Gioeli]
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me (You're crushing in your thirties, crushing in your thirties)
We are never, ever, ever, ever
I'm the Disaster of- (Good for you)
Getting back together

[Outro: Hayley Williams, Olivia Rodrigo]
It just feels so good
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily"

Viva La Vida Lyrics
I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own

I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listen as the crowd would sing
“Now the old king is dead! Long live the king!”

One minute I held the keys
Next the doors were closed on me
And I discovered that my castles stand
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
Once you go there was never
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

It was a wicked and wild wind
Blew down the doors to let me in
Shattered windows and the sound of drums
People couldn't believe what I'd become


Revolutionaries wait
For my head on a silver plate
Just a puppet on a lonely string
Oh who would ever wanna be king?

I hear Jerusalem bells a-ringing
Roman Cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword and shield
My missionaries in a foreign field

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world

For some reason I can't explain
I know Saint Peter won't call my name
Never an honest word
But that was when I ruled the world"

2021 BRIT Global Icon Award Speech Lyrics
Anyone who knows me at all knows that Game of Thrones is my life, so the fact that Maisie was here to present this
 - I wanna grab you, I can't we're social distancing, but thank you so much for coming here to do this
 - and that video, anyone that was in that video, Selena, Zoe, Ed, Griff! And, my soul left my body when Annie Lennox was on that video, that was like a thousand surprise birthday parties where all your friends are jumping out like ""ahh!"" and you're just like ""this is the best!""

I wanna thank the BRITs, or anyone who decided that I would be worthy of this incredible honor. I'm really really proud to be a part of this musical community, especially in a year where we all needed music so much, but what we needed even more was the help and support we got from the NHS and the key workers who are here tonight. Thank you for everything that you've done for us.

This is a really cool one, I love this! I am so indebted to and grateful for my British fans, I love you so much for everything you've done for me. We've had so many amazing memories inn the last 15 years, from playing Shepherd's Bush Empire, to playing the O2 Arena, to playing Wembley Stadium, and hey, because of you, last year I almost played Glastonbury so.
 But, we all know what happened next, the world changed and I ended up putting out three albums instead.

Making folklore and evermore was one of the most unique, cathartic, extraordinary experiences I've ever had. I would love the opportunity to thank the amazing creative people that I made those albums with. Thank you Aaron Dessner, thank you Jack Antonoff, Joe, Justin Vernon, The National, Marcus Mumford, Jon Low, Serban Ghenea, Laura Sisk, and HAIM. I wanna thank my friends and family, who know exactly who they are, whose opinion of me never changed whether my stock was up or down,
 if there's one thing that I've learned it's that you have to look around you everyday and take note of the people who have always believed in you, and never stop appreciating them for it, never take them for granted.

There are so many incredible new artists in this room tonight, and a lot of people watching who have goals and ambitions and dreams for themselves. I need you to hear me when I say there is no career path that comes free of negativity. If you're being met with resistance, that probably means that you're doing something new. If you're experiencing turbulence or pressure, that probably means you're rising. And there might be times when you put your whole heart and soul into something and it is met with cynicism or skepticism. You cannot let that crush you, you have to let it fuel you, because we live in a world where anyone has the right to say anything that they want about you at anytime. But just please remember that you have the right to prove them wrong.

I love you all thank you so much for this beautiful honor, thank you to the BRITs! This is amazing."

Anti-Hero (ILLENIUM Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)


[Bridge]
(For the last time)
(For the last time)
(For the last time)
(For the last time)
(For the last time)
(For the last time)
(For the last time)
(For the last time)


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Drop]
(It's me, hi)
(I'm the problem, it's, I'm the problem, it's—)
(At teatime)
(I'm the problem, it's, I'm the problem)
(It's me, hi)
(I'm the problem, it's, I'm the problem, it's—)
(At teatime)
(Everybody agrees)
(I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror)
(It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero)

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)



[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Drop]
(It's me, hi)
(I'm the problem, it's, I'm the problem, it's—)
(At teatime)
(I'm the problem, it's, I'm the problem)
(It's me, hi)
(I'm the problem, it's, I'm the problem, it's—)
(At teatime)
(Everybody agrees)

[Outro]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

Got a Bunch of Bones Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If I didn't have bones, I couldn't jump, run, swim, sit, or stand
My arm wouldn't have an elbow to bend
If I didn't have my bones
Knuckles and ankles and knees are all joints
And the bones in my fingers help me to point

[Chorus]
Got a bunch of bones inside me
Got a bunch of bones inside me, yeah
A whole bunch of bones that everyone owns
Underneath the skin we're in

[Verse 2]
My arms would flop, my shoulders would slump
My fingers would mush, I'd be one big lump
Without my bones, I'd be like gelatin
Thank goodness for my skelеton

[Chorus]
Got a bunch of bones inside me (Got a wholе bunch of bones)
Got a bunch of bones inside me, yeah (A bunch of bones)
A whole bunch of bones that everyone owns
Underneath the skin we're in (Got a whole bunch of bones)

Got a bunch of bones inside me (A bunch of bones)
Got a bunch of bones inside me, yeah (A whole bunch of bones)
A bunch of bones that everyone owns

Who Knew / Unpretty Lyrics
At a stop in Philadelphia on the Speak Now Tour, Taylor performed a cover combining songs by P!nk and TLC.
If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
I'd stand up and punch them out
Cause they're all wrong
I know better, cause you said forever
And ever, who knew?

If someone said three years from now
You'd be long gone
That last kiss, I'll cherish, until we meet again
My darling, who knew?


Because P!nk is from Philly, ladies and gentlemen!


I wish I could tie you up in my shoes
Make you feel unpretty too
I was told I was beautiful
But what does that mean to you?
Look into the mirror, who's inside there
The one with the long hair
Same old me again today, yeah

My outsides look cool
My insides are blue
Every time I think I'm through
It's because of you
I try different ways
But it's all the same
At the end of the day
I have myself to blame
I'm just trippin'


You can buy your hair if it won't grow
You can fix your nose if he says so
You can buy all the make-up
They can make, but if
You can't look inside you
Find out who am I to
Be in the position that make me feel
So
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Make you feel unpretty too

Taylor brought her friend Hayley Williams onstage at a Nashville show on her Speak Now Tour to sing Paramore’s “That’s What You Get.”
[Verse 1: Hayley Williams]
No sir
Well, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
You have made it harder just to go on
And why? All the possibilities
Well, I was wrong


[Chorus 1: Hayley Williams with (Taylor Swift)]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)


[Verse 2: Hayley Williams]
I wonder
How am I supposed to feel when you're not here?
Cause I burned every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try holding onto silly things, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities
I'm sure you've heard



[Chorus: Taylor Swift with (Hayley Williams)]
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
That's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win, (woah)


[Bridge: Hayley Williams]
Pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so inviting
If I ever start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start, hey!

Why do we like to hurt so much?
Oh, why do we like to hurt so much?
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah

That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah
That's what you get when you let your heart win, woah

The Story Of Us (Live/2011) Lyrics
[Spoken Intro]
Go!

[Verse 1]
I used to think one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
Lately, I don't even know what page you're on


[Pre-Chorus 1]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout

So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through


[Chorus]
Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking

And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


[Post-Chorus]
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doing your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day, I'll tell the story of us
Of how I was losing my mind when I saw you here

But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking

And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


[Spoken Interlude]
Can I please see you jump?

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side

The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight

[Pre-Chorus 3]
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now, I'm standing alone in a crowded room
And we're not speaking

And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now (Now, now, now)
Oh (Now, now, now)
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know
Is it killing you like it's killing me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate

You stand with your hand on your waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, it's a bad sign
Something happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circling dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame
It could burn out, it could burn out

Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
We run, we run

Cause baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
Yeah, I know places

Lights flash and we run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time, not this time



[Pre-Chorus 2]
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run
We run, we run

And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down
Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

They take their shots, we're bulletproof
And you know for me, it's always you
In the dead of night, your eyes so green
And I know for you, I know for you

Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails trying to track us down

“It’s Frightening” Poem Lyrics
Tonight all these lives converge here
The moasics of laughter and cocktails of tears
Where fraternal souls single identical things
And it's beautiful. It's rapturous. It is frightening

It's worth everything it has cost you

And even at your darkest or drunkest

You wouldn't say any different Would you?
You would choose all of it again
No matter how the story ends
With the ugliest boos or the loveliest bouquet

They say that love is a choice you make every single day

And that is how you love
The life
Of
A showgirl"

And that's what they don't know mmm, that's what they don't know mmm


[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruising, can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my body saying it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Bridge]
Hey, hey, hey, just think while you've been out there getting down
About the liars and dirty, dirty cheats in the world
You could have been getting down to this sick beat
Shake it (Shake it)
I said shake it, shake it (Shake it, shake it)
I said shake it (Shake it)
Said shake it (Shake it)
I said shake it, shake it (Shake it, shake it)
Shake it, shake it off (Shake it off)


[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

The Tortured Poets Department (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?

[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody

[Verse 2]
You smokеd, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you


[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
And who's gonna know you like me?
(Who's gonna know you?)
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
Nobody
(Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?)
Nobody

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding


[Chorus]
Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)
Me
Who's gonna know you? (Who?)
Me
And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're two idiots
Who's gonna hold you?

[Post-Chorus]
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?

[Outro]
You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
Who else decodes you?"

ME! Lyrics
[Verse 1: Sarah Blackwood]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
You're the kind of guy the ladies
There's a lot of cool chicks out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool chicks

[Pre-Chorus: Sarah Blackwood]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Sarah Blackwood]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me

[Verse 2: Gianni Luminati & Sarah Blackwood]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
And there's a lot of lame guys out there
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
And there's a lot of lame guys out there


[Pre-Chorus: Gianni Luminati & Sarah Blackwood]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Gianni Luminati & Sarah Blackwood]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me

[Bridge: Gianni Luminati & Sarah Blackwood]
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
And I promise that you'll never find another like me
Boy, there ain't no I in ""team""
But ya know there is a ""me""
And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Gianni Luminati & Sarah Blackwood]
Me, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


[Outro: Gianni Luminati & Sarah Blackwood]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me"

The Smallest Man Who Ever Lived (Live At The Eras Tour) Lyrics
[Verse]
Was any of it true?
Gazing at me starry-eyed
In your Jehovah's Witness suit
Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine
They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like

[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Bridge]
Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, ""Good riddance""
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing


[Outro]
And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
The smallest man who ever lived"

​藤井風「Shake It Off」の歌詞

[Verse 1]
I stay out too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say.. Mmm
That's what people say.. Mmm
I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say.. Mmm
That's what people say.. Mmm

[Pre-Chorus 1]
But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music
In my mind
Saying it's gonna be alright

[Chorus]
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off
Shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
Shake it off

[Verse 2]
I never miss a beat
I'm lightning on my feet
That's what they don’t see.. Mmm
That's what they don’t see.. Mmm
I'm dancing on my own
I make the moves up as I go
That's what they don't know.. Mmm
That’s what they don’t know.. Mmm

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music

[Interlude]
""Hey---
Just think while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars and the dirty dirty cheats of the world..
You could've been gettin' down
To this! Sick! Beat!""

[Bridge]
My ex man brought his new girlfriend
She's like 'oh my God!'
But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there
With the hella good hair
Won't you come on over
Baby we can shake shake shake..

[Chorus]
Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake

Folklore Interlude (Wildest Dreams x Seven) Lyrics
[Intro x Wildest Dreams]
If you wish to romanticize the woman I became
Then say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset
Or you could begin at the beginning
And in that case

[Seven]
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven,
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I was high in the sky
Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?

Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids make a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long"

Elizabeth Taylor (Original Songwriting Voice Memo) Lyrics
[Intro]
This is an idea I had for a song called ""Elizabeth Taylor""
'Cause her eyes are violet
And I kinda had this idea of, like, a lovelorn, desperate, um, love affair song
Um, here's just the basic—
I mean, obviously, change the chords, change whatever, we'll get in there and figure it out, but
Chorus idea

[Chorus]
And I'd
And I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor
Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?
Been number one, but I nеver had two
And I can't have fun if I can't have you
Bе my New York when hollywood hates me
Only as cool as your last hit, baby
Been number one, but I never had two
I can't have fun if I can't have you

[Outro]
I don't know, just an idea, but it's been stuck in my head for a couple of days, the ""Cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor / Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?""
There's a lot of really cool lyrical things we could play with
She has so many cool, like, um, movie titles that are just so cool, and like White Diamonds, National Velvet, and, the, all the Richard Burton lore
Like, I just would—
I think I'd have a bit of a blast writing this one"

Anti-Hero (Roosevelt Remix) Lyrics
[Intro]
The anti-hero
The anti-hero
The anti-hero
The anti-hero

[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


[Post-Chorus]
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


[Post-Chorus]
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) Rooting for the anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me) The anti-hero
The anti-hero
The anti-hero
The anti-hero

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Post-Chorus]
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero
(It's me, hi, it's me, hi) The anti-hero"

[Verse 1: Gary Lightbody]
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Hook: Both]
And right before your eyes
I’m breaking
No fuss, no reasons why
Just you and me
(e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he)

[Chorus: Both]

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better


[Hook: Both]
And right before your eyes
I’m aching
No fuss, nowhere to hide
Just you and me
(e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he-e-he)

[Chorus: Both]

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
(eye, eye)

[Bridge: Taylor Swift and Gary Lightbody]
This is the last time you tell me I’ve got it wrong
This is the last time I say it’s been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won’t hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho

[Chorus: Both]

This is the last time I’m asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I’m asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye


[Outro: Both]
This is the last time I’m asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I’m asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this"

Blank Space Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
“Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake.”
Love’s a game, want to play, hey?
New money, suit & tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain’t it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let’s be friends
I’m dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over, mhm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
’Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
’Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you breathless, hm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space, baby
And I’ll write your name


[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You’re the King, baby, I’m your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose gardens filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
“Oh my God, who is she?”
I get drunk on jealousy
But you’ll come back each time you leave
Cause darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over, mhm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
’Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
’Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you breathless, hm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space, baby
And I’ll write your name


[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it’s torture
Don’t say I didn’t, say I didn’t warn ya
Boys only want love if it’s torture
Don’t say I didn’t, say I didn’t warn ya

[Chorus]
So it’s gonna be forever
Or it’s gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it’s over, mhm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
’Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
’Cause we’re young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
It’ll leave you breathless, hm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I’m insane
But I’ve got a blank space, baby
And I’ll write your name"

​enough for you / 1 step forward, 3 steps back Lyrics
[Verse 1: enough for you]
I wore makeup when we dated
'Cause I thought you'd like me more
If I looked like the other prom queens
I know that you loved before
Tried so hard to be everything that you liked
Just for you to say you're not the compliment type

[Verse 2: enough for you]
And I knew how you took your coffee
And your favorite songs by heart
I read all of your self-help books
So you'd think that I was smart
Stupid, emotional, obsessive little me
I knew from the start this is exactly how you'd leave

[Chorus: enough for you]
You found someonе more exciting, the nеxt second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough for you
Yeah, all I ever wanted was to be enough for you

[Verse 3: enough for you]
And maybe I'm just not as interesting
As the girls you had before
But God, you couldn't have cared less
About someone who loved you more
I'd say you broke my heart
But you broke much more than that
Now, I don't want your sympathy
I just want myself back


[Chorus: enough for you]
Before you found someone more exciting, the next second, you were gone
And you left me there cryin', wonderin' what I did wrong
And you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough

[Chorus: 1 step forward, 3 steps back]
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand

[Bridge: 1 step forward, 3 steps back]
No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead

[Outro: enough for you]
And they'll think that I am so exciting
And you'll be the one who's crying
Yeah, you always say I'm never satisfied, but I don't think that's true
You say I'm never satisfied, but that's not me, it's you
'Cause all I ever wanted was to be enough
But I don't think anything could ever be enough for you
Enough for you, oh
No, nothing's enough for you"

This Is Really Happening Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Beneath the chandelier of stars and atmosphere
Tangled like the roots on the ground
The windows opened up
The wind is blowing and we're both not making a sound
It’s like I'm melting on into you
Give me a reason why we should ever move
And

[Chorus]
Tell me you'll never leave me
And I’m not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Verse 2]
Could this be better?
You write me letters
So you see me every day
You tend to treat me like
My name is up in lights
It really blows me away

Lock me up in a dark room
And I still can't take my eyes off you


[Chorus]
Tell me you'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy and
This is really happening
That this is really happening

[Bridge]
All those kisses up against your car
For all those wishes on planes
We thought were stars
Memories like photographs
Oh, baby, here we are

[Chorus]
Tell me you'll never leave me
And I'm not crazy
Oh, and this is really happening
Oh, oh, baby
Tell me you'll always need me
That I drive you crazy
And this is really happening
Oh, that this is really happening"

Sparks Fly (Live/2011) Lyrics
[Spoken Intro]
I don’t think you should wait, you speak now
Drop everything now

[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
And I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

I see sparks fly whenever you smile


[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
Well I could wait patiently but I really wish you would


[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

I see sparks fly whenever you smile


[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Interlude]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Drop everything now
Take away (take away) the pain
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Drop everything now
(Take away, take away the pain)
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

I see sparks fly whenever you smile

And the sparks fly"

Ruin The Friendship (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Glistening grass from September rain

Gray overpass full of neon names

You drive (Mm, mm)
Eighty-five (Mm, mm)

Gallatin Road and the Lakeside Beach

Watching the game from your brother's Jeep

Your smile (Mm, mm)
Miles wide


[Chorus]
And it was not an invitation
Should've kissed you anyway
Should've kissed you anyway
And it was not convenient, no
But your girlfriend was away
Should've kissed you anyway, hey


[Verse 2]
Shiny wood floors underneath my feet
Disco ball makes everything look cheap

Have fun (Mm, mm)
It's prom (Mm, mm)
Wilted corsage dangles from my wrist

Over his shoulder, I catch a glimpse
And see (Mm, mm)
You looking at mе


[Chorus]
And it was not an invitation
But as the 50 Cent song played (Song playеd)

Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway)
And it was not (And it was not) convenient (Convenient), no
Would've been the best mistake

Should've kissed you anyway, hey

[Bridge]
Don't make it awkward in second period
Might tick your ex off, lately, we've been good
Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should

Don't make it awkward in second period
Might tick your ex off, lately, we've been good
Staying friends is safe, doesn't mean you should

[Verse 3]
When I left school, I lost track of you
Abigail called me with the bad news

Goodbye
And we'll never know why


[Chorus]
It was not an invitation

But I flew home anyway
With so much left to say

It was not convenient, no

But I whispered at the grave
""Should've kissed you anyway,"" ooh

And it was not (It was not) an invitation (Invitation)
Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway)
Should've kissed you anyway (Anyway), anyway
And it was not—


[Post-Chorus]
My advice is to always ruin the friendship
Better that than regret it for all time

Should've kissed you anyway
And my advice is to always answer the question
Better that than to ask it all your life

Should've kissed you anyway

[Outro]
Should've kissed you anyway"

Beautiful Days Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Mh, oh yeah
A moment just passed
And I know it's hard to believe, but it could have been something
And I could have smiled your way
Maybe you’d see there's something in me that loves you

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for that sweet second that never was
That period of time, that vision in my mind
That feeling of melting into you
The time I could’ve lived it, but I didn't take a chance
Keep it on your mind, you'll always like to dance
Living like you love it, you love it just the same
'Cause life is made up of those moments
That you let slip away
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days

[Verse 2]
What if I hadn't turned around?
And I'd kept walking, and looked through your starry eyes
Well, I would have known it then
Instead of just waiting to find out if I love you

[Chorus]
I've been waiting for that sweet second that never was
That period of time, that vision in my mind
That feeling of melting into you
The time I could've lived it, but I didn’t take the chance
Keep it on your mind, you’ll always like to dance
Living like you love it, you love it just the same
Well, life is made up of those moments
That you let slip away
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days


[Bridge]
Will you love me when tomorrow comes?
It's just another Monday, baby won’t you come with me?
And see me in a different light?

I could be your angel if you want to take a chance
Baby, if you knew me, you'd know I'll always dance
Love me like you need me, and I'll be yours, true

[Outro]
All that matters to me is you, babe
You’re never gonna slip away
Life is just beautiful, life is just beautiful
Life is just beautiful, beautiful days
Beautiful days
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful days"

I Don’t Wanna Live Forever Lyrics
[Intro: Dani]
Ooooooo-oooh
Ooooooo-oooh

[Verse1: Dani]
I'm sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls
Hoping you'll call
It's just a cruel existence
Like there's no point hoping at all

[Pre-Chorus 1: Amy]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh
But you say nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus: Lisa, Dani]
And I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home (Oooooooh)
I just wanna keep calling your name (ooh)
Until you come back home (Oooooooh)
I just wanna keep calling your name (ooh)
Until you come back home


[Verse 2: Katherine]
I'm sitting eyes wide open
And I got one thing stuck on my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet
Or just lost the love of my life, woah

[Pre-Chorus 2: Lauren]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I give you something, oh
But you give me nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus: Lisa, Dani]
And I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home (Oooooooh)
I just wanna keep calling your name (ooh)
Until you come back home (Oooooooh)
I just wanna keep calling your name (ooh)
Until you come back home

[Christina & Lauren]
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
(Baby, baby, I feel crazy)
I see you around in all these empty faces
(Up all night, all night and everyday)
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
(Gave me something, oh, but you'd say nothing)
Now I'm in a cab, I show him where your place is
What is happening to me?


[Chorus: Lisa, Dani]
And I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home (Oooooooh)
I just wanna keep calling your name (ooh)
Until you come back home (Oooooooh)
I just wanna keep calling your name (ooh)
Until you come back home (Oooooooh)
I just wanna keep calling your name (ooh)
Until you come back home (Oooooooh)
I said I just wanna keep calling your name (ooh)
Until you come back home (Oooooooh)

Honey (Original Songwriting Voice Memo) Lyrics
Yeah
One, two, three, four
Oh-oh-oh
You can call me anything you want, anything you want, you want
Ooh-ooh-ooh
You can call me anytime you want if you mean it when you talk
Yeah
When you talk, or like, yeah
Yeah, yeah, love
When you talk
I'm gonna record to remember those notes, maybe those notes, or not exactly, but they are, but play through the chorus, one, two, three, four
Honey
He was standing in the bathroom, white tee
He was saying that skirt didn't fit me and I cried the whole way home
If anyone called me ""honеy""
He was standing at the bathroom, white tee
You wеre saying that skirt don't fit me and I cried the whole way home
But you
Ooh-ooh-ooh
You can call me anything you want, anything you want, you want
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, wait, wait, wait
But doesn't it go then into
You love my face
Redefine all of those blues
When you say ""Honey""
Post tune, bla-bla-bla
You can call me anything you want, anything you want, you want
That's what I think it is
'Cause we go into that
You touch my face
Jazzy
Redefine all of those blues
It's last in this key
But then we go back to the chorus chords
La-da-na-na
You can call me anything you want, anything you want, you want
Na-na-na
You can call me anytime at all, as long as you mean it when you talk
So we don't have that in the bridge?
Touch my face
That's the pre
Right there
Face, redefine all of those blues
When you say ""Honey""
The bridge
Ah-ah-ah
You can call me anything you want, anything you want, you want
It's in the chorus, but it's like that
I think it's like, it's like
A pre-chorus going into this, like, explosive pop post-hook of just, 'cause, I just, I think that's what it is
No, no, no, I'm saying
When you say ""Honey""
So, you're saying, 'cause you're still, so, so, so
Just to try to find my
Okay, here
Um
So you're saying that the
So that's a part
And then the you, is that like a—
That's like a pre-chorus
That's like your verse
The way I'm looking at it, in terms of just structurewise
The first thing we hear is
If anyone called me sweetheart
Right?
Then you go into
But you touch my face
Redefine all of those blues
When you say
Then the track gets bigger
Honey
And it's romantic
It sounds romantic
You can tell me anything you want, anything you want, you want
Right
You can call me anytime at all, 'cause you mean it when you talk
That's how it goes
It could be, I don't know
And then what happens after that, like, the hook?
If anyone called me late night
It was in a different manner
My mind
He was saying
It could be just one of those—
I think we have to record the chorus to get it
It's a little confusing in my head
But I love that thing
Yeah
It's just like, where do we—
'Cause I was in love with the verse idea
But let's record with instruments
Yeah"

Halfway to Texas Lyrics
“Halfway to Texas” was featured on a 2003 demo CD, which was shared by Brian Mansfield via Instagram in November 2018. As of July 2019, no audio has surfaced online.
[Verse 1]
When I got mad at you, I always said I'd move to Texas
As a crazy little girl, what was I supposed to do?
And I'm still crazy and I guess I haven't gotten much better
You're getting complicated, so I'll hit the road for someplace new

[Chorus]
Well, I'm halfway to Texas, enjoying this roadside view
Just clearing my head, trying not to think back on you
And I'm trying to be strong
Maybe this whole thing is wrong
So I'll focus on the winding road leading to Texas

[Verse 2]
The wind in my hair is reminding me of the way you held me
Back home is far, I won't give up just yet
Right now you'll probably call wondering what I'm doing
And a voice in the wind will tell you I'm a long time gone

[Chorus]
Well, I'm halfway to Texas, kinda thinking back on you
There's a thought in my head saying my best option is you
And I hope I can stay strong
I'm starting to think this is wrong
I'll just focus on the winding road leading to Texas


[Bridge]
I've stopped the car, all I can think of is you
Maybe you were right, now I know how much I love you

[Outro]
I'm halfway to Texas, I'm turned around 'cause I love you
I'm coming back to you darling, wanna spend my life with you
And I know I have this wrong
I've stayed away from you this long
I'm taking you with me next time I go to Texas
I'm taking you with me next time I go to Texas"

Mary Jo Lyrics
“Mary Jo” was featured on a 2003 demo CD, which was shared by Brian Mansfield via Instagram in November 2018. As of July 2019, no audio has surfaced online, and it’s unclear who Mary Jo is.
[Verse 1]
There's a little green house off a gravel road
’Bout a mile from Bobby Freeman's farm
Mary Jo runs her own little flower shop
Courtesy of the old red barn
My mama's mama’s lifelong friend, Jo
Didn't like the people of town
Four kids and wildflowers and calla lilies
Jo'd rather have them around

[Pre-Chorus]
Got me a letter, said
""You gotta come home
I'm feeling a little bit low
It's lilac season and I need some help
Keeping my garden grown
Signed, Mary Jo""

[Chorus]
So many questions answered
When I spent that summer with Jo
Lavender pillows and weeping willows
Things I would never have known
'Til Mary Jo

[Verse 2]
We collected bouquets and made lemonade
Mixed rose water perfume
Jo started giving and I started living
Under the pale blue moon
Sang to Jo's records and Sweet Home Kentucky
Watching her garden grow
Says I'm smart and always was lucky
Now I’ll never really know
XO, Mary Jo


[Chorus]
So many questions answered
When I spent that summer with Jo
Lavender pillows and weeping willows
Things I would never have known
’Til Mary Jo

[Bridge]
Summer started packing its bags
And Mary Jo had something on her mind
Cleared her throat and swallowed real hard
And said ""My voice seems to be in a bind
But when I wrote that letter I was really sick
The doctor said I was gonna go
Then you came home and it seems to be gone
You made something in that garden grow
But we'll never know""
Said Mary Jo

[Chorus]
So many questions answered
When I spent that summer with Jo
Lavender pillows and weeping willows
Things I would never have known
’Til Mary Jo"

Fortnight Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was just keepin' it copasetic

’Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here’s to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna tell hеr


[Verse 2]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless Fеbruary
Went with a miracle move-on mood
, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I loved you for only a fortnight

I loved you, but I loved you

[Chorus]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna tell her

And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
Your husband is dreaming, I wanna tell him



[Bridge]
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I loved you for only a fortnight
I loved you, I loved you
I love you, it’s ruining my life
I love you, it’s ruining my life
I loved you for only a fortnight
I loved you, I loved you

[Outro]
Thought of callin' ya, but you won’t pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you love, love, love me

Thought of calling ya, but you won’t pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til I love, love, love you"

Come Back...Be Here Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Said it in a simple way
4 AM, the second day
How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you

[Chorus]
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here

[Verse 2]
The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all
And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Taxi cabs and busy streets
They never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you

[Chorus 2]
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here
(Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh)

[Bridge]
This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
You're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around

[Chorus]
This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today
And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here"

Anti-Hero (Behind The Song) Lyrics
[Spoken]
The story of ""Anti-Hero"" is that it really encapsulates this album and sort of the darkest corners of your mind when you can't sleep. Playing out a dismal version of your very dark future, um, being afraid of what everyone thinks about you. Really exploring your own self-loathing and kind of having a shocking, scary self-awareness about your flaws as a human being, you know? Anxiety, it's, uh, it's all throughout this song."

You Need to Calm Down Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn (Damn), it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, (Hey) are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun, yeah
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be so GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark age
Just makin' that sign must've taken all night


[Pre-Chorus 2]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate, yeah
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down
You need to calm down
Don't step on our gowns, you need to calm down"

“The Best Day” is a cover of American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift’s song of the same name. Cook mentioned his cover of the song in February 2018, over two years before it would finally be released:
[Verse]
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home"

Karma (Behind The Song) Lyrics
[Spoken]
So, one of the themes about Midnights is how you're feeling in the middle of the night, and that can be intense self-hatred, intense self-love; you go through these very polarizing emotions when you're up late at night and your brain just spirals. It can spiral downward and it can spiral way up, and you can be really feeling yourself, and ""Karma"" is written from a perspective of feeling really happy, really proud of the way your life is, feeling like this must be a reward for going stuff right. It's a song that I really love because I think wе all need some of those moments, you know, wе can't just be beating ourselves up all the time. You have to have these moments where you're like, ""You know what? Karma is my boyfriend,"" and that's it."

Love Story Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That we were meant to be but no one else agrees
But I don't care about them because you're all I need
And I was crying on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go""
And I said

[Chorus]
Baby, just take me somewhere we can bе alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
We'll go far away and we'll make it out this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh-oh


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause we were meant to be, but no one else agrees
But I don't care about them because you're all I need
And you were everything to me
Begging you, ""Please don't go""
And I said

[Chorus]
Baby, just take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
We don't need a prince and you're not a damsel in distress
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

Darling, won't you save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

[Breakdown]
""Darling, won't you save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
She knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


[Chorus]
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
We'll go far away
I will take you out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

[Outro]
Oh, oh-oh
Ooh, ooh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

But she's looking at you, oh, oh

Bejeweled (Behind The Song) Lyrics
[Spoken]
The song ""Bejeweled"" is a song that I think is really about finding confidence when you feel that it's been taken away, for whatever reason. You know, you're feeling insecure, you're feeling taken for granted. One of the things we love to do at night is we love to go dancing, we love to put on an outfit that makes us feel good, and we love to feel like we're still bejeweled. And I think that there are tiny inflections of me, hyping myself up to return to pop music after spending these glorious years writing folk songs and being in this metaphorical forest that I've created. Which I've loved so much but there, there was like a bit of pumping myself back up to be like, ""You can do it, you're still bejeweled,"" like, ""I'm still bejeweled, question mark?"" Um, we'll see, but that's what the song's about."

You’re Not Sorry (CSI Remix) Lyrics
[Intro]
All this time, time, time...
All this time, time, time...

[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again but not this time around

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Verse 2]
You're looking so innocent
I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before but


[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)

[Bridge]
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright but I watched all of it fade so

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry (No no no no)
You're not sorry (No no no no)
(No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no)
Woah, oh, oh oh, oh oh oh

I Can Do It With a Broken Heart Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I can read your mind
""She's having the time of her life""
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(One, two, three, four)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle it
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, and smile
Even when you wanna fly

He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the piecеs of me shattered as thе crowd was chanting, ""More""

I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I'm so obsessed
, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed
 with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart


[Verse 2]
I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
(One, two, three, four)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle it
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, and smile
I can run it for miles

He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I'm so obsessed
, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart


[Outro]
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good
And I'm good
'Cause I'm miserable (Haha)
And nobody even knows
Ah, try and come for my job"

Last Kiss Lyrics
[Verse 1: Megan and Liz]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away

[Verse 2: Boyce Avenue]
I do recall now
The smell of the rain fresh on the pavement
You ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of my heart it jumped through my shirt
Hope you still feel my arms

[Chours: Megan and Liz & Boyce Avenue]
Now I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 3:Megan and Liz]
I do remember the swing in your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you I did


[Verse 4: Boyce Avenue]
Because you love my handshake, meeting your father
Said he loved how I walk with my hands in my pockets
How I'd kiss you when you were in the middle of saying something
I pray that you still miss those rude interruptions

[Chours: Megan and Liz & Boyce Avenue]
Now I'll go sit on the floor, wearing your clothes
All that I know is that I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Bridge: Megan and Liz & Boyce Avenue]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I'll feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you, you wish you had stayed
I never planned on making you cry
But not letting go would be living a lie

[Chours: Megan and Liz & Boyce Avenue]
So I'll go sit on the floor
Wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know how to be something you miss
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips


[Outro: Megan and Liz & Boyce Avenue]
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last..."

Mean (Live/2011) Lyrics
Live version of Taylor’s song, Mean, on the Speak Now World Tour.
[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me

You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you

I just wanna feel okay again


[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing

All you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean


[Breakdown]
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"

Decade of Pop: The 2000s (100 Song Mashup) Lyrics
[Intro]
Tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock, tick-tock

It's been a long time
 (La-da-da-da-dah)

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)
 I did it again

Come on, everybody, get on up

Get your (Go), get your, get your, get your, get your freak on

One more time

I'm comin' up, so you better get this party started

Alright, alright
 (Da da dup)

Go, go, go
 (Oh oh, oh oh, oh no no)

Oh, take me back to the start

Take that and rewind it back

Go
 change who I used to be

Get down girl, go 'head, get down

How did it end up like this?

Just a line in a song
 still unwritten

And how every song reminds me of what used to be

It’s too late
, all that we went through

Ahhhhhhhhhh yuuuuuu

Time starts to pass before you know it
I close my eyes and the flashback starts, I'm standing there

Yeah (Ra-ra, ah-ah-ah) (Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh) yeah, yeah
We shared a moment that will stay a while, stay forever
It's all been done before in every single way, I'm gonna be okay
Few times I've been 'round that track, no matter what I do
It should be about us 'cause I like that, yeah
They don't make 'em like this anymore


[Verse 1]
So get what we're sold, get what we did
Before we got too old
I lost a part of me, I did not recognize
And now I'm tryin' to get back (Back again)
Do you think time, would pass me by?
I'll be here forever (Forever, forever, forever)
Right now this is how you remind me
Here is where you wanna be
Everybody needs somebody
And I ain't going nowhere so you can get to know
No matter where I go I know where I came from
The music, the moment, baby
Never let it go
Remember the time, baby
I remember, everything
If you had one moment, would you capture, Or just let it slip?

[Verse 2]
I remember when, I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
I love this record but I’m slipping under day and night
Don't you know you can never go back?
It's not the same, it doesn’t matter
Carry me home
Give this song another listen, close your eyes
With what's just transpired
You spin my head right round, right round
Oh baby, when you talk like that
Are you down, down, down, down, down?
The memories fade, like looking through a fogged mirror (Ooh)
It's funny how it’s the little things in life, that mean the most innocent can never last (All I know)
Time is a valuable thing, watch it fly by as the pendulum swings
Time goes by, I don't know what to do since you've been gone
For some reason I can't explain (Woo-hoo) your memory will carry on


[Verse 3]
I gotta feeling, I can't get you out of my head
Let's escape into the music, DJ let it play (Mmm-mmm-mmm)
And the visions coming from my eyes said leave it alone
(Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa)
But it's time for me to go home (Hey, ya)
Even I know that, ain't nothin’ new now
And I say the same thing every single time
Mix a little bit of *uh* with my iPod stuck on replay

Tonight, you come and pick me up

Long drive, could end in broken hearts or paradise

It's been a while since I have even heard from you (Heard from you)
I should just tell you to leave 'cause I know exactly where it leads

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red dress, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
You've got that long hair slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and my favorite shirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red dress,

And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

You've got that long hair slicked back, white T-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and my favorite shirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

Take me home
Just take me home
Yeah, just take me home, oh
Out of style

Betty Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it’s 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn’t breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust mе
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Verse 2]
Bеtty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him


[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Bridge]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said ""Chris, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long


[Verse 3]
Betty, I’m here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it’s finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again

[Pre-Chorus]
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party

[Chorus]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I’m only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you"

You Belong With Me Lyrics
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's goin' off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listenin' to the kind of music she doesn't like
She'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

If you could see that
I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See you belong with me?
You belong with me

Walkin' the streets with you and your worn out jeans
I can't help thinkin' this is how it ought to be
Laughin' on a park bench thinkin' to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doin' with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreamin' 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

If you could see that
I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you
See you belong with me?

Standin' by and waitin' at your backdoor
All this time, how could you not know
Baby, you belong with me?
You belong with me

Oh, I remember you drivin' to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry

And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

Can't you see that
I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you
See you belong with me?


Standin' by and waitin' at your backdoor
All this time, how could you not know?
Baby, you belong with me
You belong with me

You belong with me
Have you ever thought
Just maybe you belong with me?
You belong with me"

A Message From Taylor (You Don’t Get to Tell Me About Sad Songs) Lyrics
Hey Apple Music, welcome to my ""You Don’t Get to Tell Me About Sad"" playlist
These songs all have one thing in common
I wrote them while feeling anger
Over the years I've learned that anger can manifest itself in a lot of different ways, but the healthiest way that it manifests in my life is when I can write a song about it and then often times that helps me get past it"

Fortnight (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him


[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

[Outro: Post Malone, Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you"

Wildest Dreams (DragonForce’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I said, ""Let's get out of this town
Far from the city, far from the crowd""
Heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall, handsome as hell
'Cause he's so bad, does it so well
See at the end as it begins
But my last condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
In a nice dress
At the sunset
Red lips and rosy cheeks
See me again
Even if it's in your
Wildest dreams, whoa
Wildest dreams, whoa

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one will know what we do""
Hands in my hair, clothes in my room
Voice a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever


[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall, handsomе as hell
'Cause he's so bad, doеs it so well
And when we've had very last kiss
But my last request is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
In a nice dress
At the sunset
Red lips and rosy cheeks
See me again
Even if it's in your
Wildest dreams, whoa
Wildest dreams, whoa

[Bridge]
See me in hindsight
Tangled up all night
Burnin' it all right down
Someday, you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
To break down

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
In a nice dress
At the sunset
Red lips and rosy cheeks
See me again

Wildest dreams, whoa
Wildest dreams, whoa

Cruel Summer (LP Giobbi Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feelin' I've got

And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Post-Chorus]
With you
With you
With you


[Chorus]
New, the shapе of your body

It's blue, the feelin' I've got

And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruеl summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying

[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feelin' I've got

And it's ooh, woah-oh

No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you


[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true (Ooh, woah-oh)
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you (It's a cruel summer)
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth (Ooh, woah-oh)
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"" (It's a cruel summer)
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body

It's blue, the feelin' I've got

And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)

Everything Has Changed (Remix) Lyrics
[Intro: Ed Sheeran]
(You good to go?)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know somethin' now
Know somethin' now I didn't before
And all I've seen since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, makin' me feel like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift with Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


[Verse 2: Ed Sheeran]
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
Well I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
Takin' flight, makin' me feel right-like

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro: Taylor Swift & Ed Sheeran]
All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed"

Vigilante S**t (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

[Chorus]
I don't start it, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

[Verse 2]
She needed cold, hard proof, so I gavе her some
She had thе envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Drivin' in your Benz
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge

[Chorus]
She don't start it, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately, she's been dressing for revenge


[Bridge]
Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough

[Verse 3]
While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shh again

[Chorus]
I don't start it, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge"

TAYLOR vs. TREADMILL Lyrics
Open in gym. TAYLOR SWIFT is bopping her head. She puts her headphones in.

TAYLOR: Man, I hate cardio.


TAYLOR opens Apple Music.

TAYLOR: Activity playlists, running...#GYMFLOW. Drake and Future.


""Jumpman"" by Drake and Future starts playing. Taylor starts mouthing the words. She is running on a treadmill.

[Intro: Drake & Future & Taylor Swift]
If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you
Yeah, yeah
Halloween
I'm gon' shoot you
Yeah


TAYLOR starts rapping the song out loud.

[Verse 1: Drake & Taylor Swift]
Jumpman, Jumpman, Jumpman, them boys up to something
They just spent like two or three weeks out the country
Them boys up to something, they just not just bluffing
You don't have to call, I hit my dance like Usher, woo
I just found my tempo like I'm DJ Mustard, woo
I hit that Ginobili with my left hand up like wo--


TAYLOR falls face-first onto the treadmill while it is still running. It carries her off and throws her onto the floor, face down. Meanwhile, ""Jumpman"" is still playing.
[Verse 1 cont: Drake & Drake & Taylor Swift]
Lobster and Céline for all my babies that I miss
Chicken fingers, French fries for them that wanna diss

Cut to black advertising screen. ""Jumpman"" is still playing, but it is just Drake rapping now.

Fresh Out The Slammer (Acoustic Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Fresh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 1]
Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder
He don't understand me
Splintered back in winter, silent dinners, bitter
He was with her in dreams

[Pre-Chorus]
Gray and blue and fights and tunnels
Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine
Years of labor, locks, and ceilings
In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you
Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)

[Verse 2]
Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge
As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again


[Pre-Chorus]
My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
Watch me daily disappearing
For just one glimpse of his smile
All those nights, he kept me goin'
Swirled you into all of my poems
Now we're at the starting line, I did my time

[Chorus]
Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'

[Bridge]
To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)
To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams
And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here
At the park where we used to sit on children's swings
Wearing imaginary rings

[Outro]
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time"

Should’ve Said No (Live) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Well, yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & (Jonas Brothers)]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet

You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift & Joe Jonas]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Joe Jonas]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & (Jonas Brothers)]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me
Oh, whoa

[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Jonas Brothers, Joe Jonas]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No no, no, no

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & (Jonas Brothers)]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

Thank you very much"
The Power of Pop,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-the-power-of-pop-annotated,"2 Contributors
The Power of Pop Lyrics
Taylor wrote this essay about her view of pop music in place of an interview for her April 2019 cover of Elle UK.
My favorite kinds of books to read are the ones that do more than just tell you a story. They do more than just set the scene or paint the picture. The writing I love the most places you into that story, that room, that rain soaked kiss. You can smell the air, hear the sounds, and feel your heart race as the character's does. It’s something F. Scott Fitzgerald did so well, to describe a scene so gorgeously interwoven with rich emotional revelations, that you yourself have escaped from your own life for a moment.


I'm highly biased, but I think that the way music can transport you back to a long-forgotten memory is the closest sensation we have to traveling in time. To this day, when I hear ""Cowboy Take Me Away"" by the Dixie Chicks, I instantly recall the feeling of being twelve years old, sitting in a little wood paneled room in my family home in Pennsylvania. I'm clutching a guitar and learning to play the chords and sing the words at the same time, rehearsing for a gig at a coffee house.
 When I hear ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"" by Panic! At The Disco, I’m transported back to being sixteen and driving down the streets of Hendersonville, Tennessee, with my best friend Abigail, euphorically screaming the lyrics.
 When I hear ""How to Save a Life"" by The Fray, ""Breathe (2AM)"" by Anna Nalick, or ""The Story"" by Brandi Carlile, I immediately flashback to being seventeen and on tour for months on end. When I'd get a day at home in between long stretches on the road sharing a van with my band and crew, I would spend my rare nights off painting alone with candles lit in my room – just being alone with those songs (Those are all from the Grey's Anatomy soundtrack. My commitment to that show truly knows no bounds). I'm convinced that ""You Learn"" by Alanis Morissette, ""Put Your Records On"" by Corinne Bailey Rae and ""Why"" by Annie Lennox have actually healed my heart after bad breakups or let downs.


I love writing songs because I love preserving memories, like putting a picture frame around a feeling you once had. I like to use nostalgia as inspiration when I'm writing songs for the same reason I like to take photographs. I like to be able to remember the extremely good and extremely bad times. I want to remember the color of the sweater, the temperature of the air, the creak of the floorboards, the time on the clock when your heart was stolen or shattered or healed or claimed forever.

The fun challenge of writing a pop song is squeezing those evocative details into the catchiest melodic cadence you can possibly think of. I thrive on the challenge of sprinkling personal mementos and shreds of reality into a genre of music that is universally known for being, well, universal. You'd think that as pop writers, we're supposed to be writing songs that everyone can sing along to, so you'd assume they would have to be pretty lyrically generic… AND YET the ones I think cut through the most are actually the most detailed, and I don’t mean in a Shakespearean sonnet type of way, although I love Shakespeare as much as the next girl. Obviously. (See ""Love Story,"" 2009).


In modern pop, songs/bops/chunes including extremely personal details like ""Kiki, do you love me"" and ""Baby pull me closer in the backseat of your rover"" have been breaking through on the most global cultural level.
 This year on tour, I got to hear stadium crowds passionately sing along to a young woman from Cuba singing about Havana.


I think these days, people are reaching out for connection and comfort in the music they listen to. We like being confided in and hearing someone say, ""this is what I went through"" as proof to us that we can get through our own struggles. We actually do NOT want our pop music to be generic. I think a lot of music lovers want some biographical glimpse into the world of our narrator, a hole in the emotional walls people put up around themselves to survive. This glimpse into the artist’s story invites us to connect it to our own, and in the best case scenario, allows us the ability to assign that song to our memories. It's this alliance between a song and our memories of the times it helped us heal, or made us cry, dance, or escape that truly stands the test of time. Just like a great book."

21 Candles Lyrics
Verse One
Patent balloons
Lit silhouettes
One crowded room
It’s almost like I imagined it
No one has a clue
That you were on the list
If only they knew
You were my wasted birthday wish

Chorus
And there’s 21 candles
Under flickering lights
They’re playing our song
The one from our very first night (I’m staring at)
21 candles
Thinking this just ain’t right
How could time go on
Without you be my side
21, 21, 21 candles
But you’re my only wish tonight

Verse Two
I pass through the room
In between goodbyes
Try not to wonder whеre you are
And who’s by your side
I Tеll myself you knew
The right place and time
Guess you don’t care
That I’m cleaning up my own party tonight


Chorus 2
Oh but there’s 21 candles
Still stuck in plain sight
One for every tear I didn’t let myself cry
Oh no 21 candles
Couldn’t make this seem right
So I’ll lie to myself
Say Maybe you missed your flight
Oh 21, 21, 21 candles
But you’re my only wish tonight

Bridge
21 mistakes that I’ve made
From 21 times that I looked away
Oh 21 debts that I’ll have to pay
For 21 lies you made me believe
And 21 hearts, not enough break?
I lived 21 years before you ruined me
Oh and 21 times that I’ll rue the day
But not today on my birthday

Chorus 3
Cause theres 21 candles
Blown out like a light
One after another wasted on your goodbye
I’m lighting 21 more candles
This time I’ll get it right
Won't hope for the best, because I know this time
That 21, 21, 21 candles
Will help me forget you tonight"

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it

Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer

And it's ooh, whoa oh

No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
She looks up, grinning like a devil

[Breakdown]
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""


[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer

Soon, you'll get better

What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

And you're the kind of guy the ladies want

You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away

Can you lie next to her
And give her your heart, your heart
As well as your body
And can you lie next to her
And confess your love, your love
As well as your folly
And can you kneel before the king
And say I'm clean, I'm clean

Tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
Oh tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart

A white blank page and a swelling rage, rage
You did not think when you sent me to the brink, to the brink
You dеsired my attention but deniеd my affections, my affections

Tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart
Oh tell me now, where was my fault
In loving you with my whole heart

Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life
Lead me to the truth and I will follow you with my whole life"

Wood (Original Songwriting Voice Memo) Lyrics
So now, and here’s the sing-along part
You know, that’s the thing
But I don’t have the melody, but I say…
No, it’s great, because you can also do plays on the word wood

Like, knock on wood or wish you wood
Then you, you know wood
But that’s the sing-along moment
We really have, I think we really have the beat
We don’t really have anything really written in stone, but like, there is the party moment
I totally agree
With the drunk people singing along
Click, click, wood
Yeah, that’s so sick
Do you wanna [?]
Da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Like, knock on wood or wish you wood
Then you, you know wood
But that’s the sing-along moment
We really have, I think we really have the beat
We don’t really have anything really written in stone, but like, there is the party moment
I totally agree
With the drunk people singing along
Click, click, wood
Yeah, that’s so sick
Do you wanna [?]
Da-da, da-da, da-da
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Yeah, but always, I think always, click, click, wood

I know you would, I know you would, I ain’t got a, wood

Jesus, I love it when you go away and you come back and go, you’re going to be mad at me

I know you could, I wish you would, so I ain’t got a, wood

[?] Sing it again. [?]"

ME! (Billboard Music Awards Live Rehearsal Audio) Lyrics
Following a performance of “ME!” at the 2019 Billboard Music Awards, Swift’s webstore offered a limited-edition vinyl and CD featuring an audio from a rehearsal.
[Intro: Taylor Swift]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


[Verse 2: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
Hey, kids!
Spelling is fun!

I'm Taylor Swift
I'm Brendon Urie
Welcome to the Billboard Music Awards, ladies and gentlemen
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
I promise that you'll never find another like


[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Brendon Urie]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a ""me""
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh)
Baby, that's the fun of me
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
You can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Spoken: Brendon Urie & Taylor Swift]
Well, that was much better except the mic [*bleep*] up
I also screwed up all the choreography
That's what I did, I'm gonna rehearse
I'm gonna rehearse and rehearse!"

Wildest Dreams (R3hab Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
In your Wildest dreams
Wildest dreams, ah-aah

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now


[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks

Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa (Ah-aah, haa)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
In your Wildest dreams
Wildest dreams, ah-aah"

Love Story Lyrics
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On the balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say hello
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go!""
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while


'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet!""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go!""
And I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring and said


Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say yes

Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

We were both young when I first saw you"

I Don’t Wanna Live Forever Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh … Oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh … Oh-oh

[Verse 1]
Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like there's no point hoping at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Verse 2]
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?


[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (Fit, babe) wherever (Wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Bridge]
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home


[Outro]
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
Until you come back home"

A Message From Taylor (Old Habits Die Screaming Songs) Lyrics
Hi Apple Music, welcome to my ""Old Habits Die Screaming"" playlist where we're gonna be exploring the feelings of depression that often lace their way through my songs
In times like these I'll write a song because I feel lonely or hopeless and writing a song feels like the only way to process that intensity of an emotion
And while these things are really, really hard to go through, I often feel like when I'm either listening to songs or writing songs that deal with this intensity of loss and hopelessness, usually thats in the phase where I'm close to getting past that feeling"

Safe And Sound Lyrics
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, ""I'll never let you go""
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Don't you dare look out your window darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
Ha La
Ha La
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh
Oooh, Oooh, Oooh, Oooh

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

I Knew You Were Trouble Lyrics
Once upon a time a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies He'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
And the saddest fear comes creeping in
That you never loved me or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (you were right there, you were right there)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble"

Paper Rings (Live from Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour) Lyrics
[Intro]
I think it's time to play ""Paper Rings""

[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I’ve read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me once 'cause I know you had a long night
Kiss me twice 'cause it’s gonna be alright
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want


[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I’m with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother’s wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me once ’cause I know you had a long night
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright
Kiss— times 'cause I waited my whole life
One, two, one, two, three, four

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I’d marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Bridge]
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy


[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ha, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Outro]
You're the one I want
Darling, you're the one I want
You're the one I want

(Minneapolis, that was incredibly loud)"

​willow Lyrics
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneaking in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

My Boy Only Breaks His Favorite Toys (Live From Paris) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Oh, here we go again
The voices in his head
Called the rain to end our days of wild

The sickest army doll

Purchased at the mall
Rivulets descend my plastic smile

[Pre-Chorus]
But you should've seen him when he first got me

[Chorus]
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
There was a litany of reasons why
We could've played for keeps this time
I know I'm just repeating myself
Put me back on my shelf
But first, pull the string
And I'll tell you that he runs
Because he loves me


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me

[Chorus]
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
Saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Once I fix me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
He's gonna miss me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Once I fix me
He's gonna miss me

[Outro]
Just say when, I'd play again
He was my best friend down at the sandlot
I felt more when we played pretend

Than with all the Kens
'Cause he took me out of my box
Stole my tortured heart
Left all these broken parts
Told me I'm better off
But I'm not
I'm not, I'm not"

All Too Well Lyrics
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you still got it in your drawer even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost Upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone
And that magic's not here no more
And I might be okay
But I'm not fine at all

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were looking over me
Wind in my hair, I was there, I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-size bed
And your mother's telling stories about you on a tee ball team
You tell me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone
And there was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to...


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We dance around the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there, I remember it all too well, yeah

Maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
And maybe this thing was a masterpiece before you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there, I remember it all too well

Hey, you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all too well"

[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you (oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—

Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me—)

Now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)


[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)


[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Yeah, if you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
Now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood (Hey!)"

I’m Only Me When I’m With You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Friday night, beneath the stars
In a field behind your yard
You and I are paintin' pictures in the sky
And sometimes, we don't say a thing
Just listen to the crickets sing
Everything I need is right here by my side

[Pre-Chorus]
I know everything about you
I don't wanna live without you

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know what I feel is true
That I'm only me when I'm with you

[Verse 2]
Just a small-town boy and girl
Livin' in a crazy world
Tryna figure out what is and isn't true
I don't try to hide my tears
My secrets or my deepest fears
Through it all, nobody gets me like you do


[Pre-Chorus]
But you know everything about me
You say that you can't live without me

[Chorus]
I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know what I feel is true
That I'm only me when I'm with you

[Bridge]
When I'm with anybody else
It's so hard to be myself
And only you can tell

[Chorus]
That I'm only up when you're not down
Don't wanna fly if you're still on the ground
It's like no matter what I do
Well, you drive me crazy half the time
The other half, I'm only tryin' to
Let you know what I feel is true
And I'm only me
Who I wanna be
Yeah, I'm only me when I'm with you"

Anti-Hero (triple j Like A Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people, I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis - tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
For the last time

[Chorus]
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
I literally never feel like anyone's a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism?
Like some kind of congressman
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
For the last time

[Chorus]
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Smelly Cat (Live on The 1989 World Tour) Lyrics
[Intro]
Three, four...

[Chorus]
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
What are they feeding you?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
It's not your fault

[Verse 1]
They won't take you to the vet
You're obviously not their favorite pet

[Chorus]
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
It's not your fault

[Verse 2]
You may not be a bed of roses
You're not friend to those with noses
I'll miss you before we're done
Or the world will smell as one

[Chorus]
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
What are they feeding you?
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
It's not your fault
Oh, are we done?


[Post-Chorus]
One, two, what's that smell?

[Chorus 2]
Smеlly Cat, Smelly Cat
What are they feeding you?
Smеlly Cat, Smelly Cat
You're getting fat
I think that I'm gonna be sick
It's your ears, and nose and pick
Part of it, tempt me

[Post-Chorus]
One, two, what's that smell?

[Chorus 3]
All the dogs in the neighborhood
Are saying this for your own good
What, you're fat, so you can't run
No fun, I bet, No fun
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
Porno makes you eat like that
I saw you in the shopping mall

[Chorus]
Smelly Cat
It's not your fault
Smelly Cat
It's not your fault
Smelly Cat, Smelly Cat
It's not your fault
We know what was in your food
They say it might affect your mood


[Outro]
You smell like something dead
You smell like something dead
You smell like something dead
You smell like something dead
One, two, what's that smell?
Yeah, that's not the song"

Out of the Woods Lyrics
[Verse 1: Male + Female]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were sitting on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus: Male & Female]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good


[Post-Chorus: Female]
Are we out of the world?

[Verse 2: Male + Female + Together]
Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus: Male & Female]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good


[Post-Chorus: Female]
Are we out of the world?

[Bridge: Female]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
20 stitches in a hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out and said I'm setting you free
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me
You were looking at me, ooh
I remember, oh I remember

[Chorus: Male & Female]
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet?
In the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods?

Begin Again (feat. Megan Nicole & Alex Goot) Lyrics
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
But I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
You always said you didn't get this song
But I do
I do

Walked in expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause
He never did
I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again


You said you never met one boy who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy
But I do

And you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause
He never did
I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again

And we walked
Down the block, to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start
To talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I want to talk about that
And for the first time
What's past is past


And you throw your head back laughing
Like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny cause
He never did
I've been spending the last 8 months
Thinking all love ever does
Is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again

Yeah but on a Wednesday in a cafe
I watched it begin again"

Evermore [Foreword] Lyrics
To put it plainly, we just couldn’t stop writing songs. To try and put it more poetically, it feels like we were standing on the edge of the folklorian woods and had a choice: to turn and go back or to travel further into the forest of this music. We chose to wander deeper in. I’ve never done this before. In the past I’ve always treated albums as one-off eras and moved onto planning the next one after an album was released. There was something different with folklore. In making it, I felt less like I was departing and more like I was returning. I loved the escapism I found in these imaginary/not imaginary tales. I loved the ways you welcomed the dreamscapes and tragedies and epic tales of love lost and found into your lives. So I just kept writing them."

One Thing Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It wasn't just like a movie
The rain didn't soak through my clothes
Down to my skin
I'm driving away, and I
I guess you could say
This is the last I drive this away again
And there's nothing to say and I
Try to grab at the fray 'cause I
I still love you, but I can't

[Chorus]
Well, bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
Yeah

[Verse 2]
The picture frame is empty
It's black and white, you're smiling down at me
I take your photo off the dash
And back to the conversation
Was so sure of everything
Everything we thought we'd always have
I'm lost in the sound of it
The here and the now comes in
Seems like I'm becoming
Part of your past


[Chorus]
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
Yeah

[Bridge]
There's so much that I can't touch
You're all I want, but it's not enough this time
And I can feel you, like you're slipping through my hands
And I'm so scared of how this ends

[Chorus]
Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad but it's come down to nothing
All you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
Well, bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad but it's coming down to nothing
And all you have is to walk away
From the one thing I thought would never leave me
Yeah, there was one thing
I knew would never leave me

It wasn't just like a movie

Houston Rodeo Lyrics
“Houston Rodeo” was featured on a 2003 demo CD, which was shared by Brian Mansfield via Instagram in November 2018. As of October 2019, no audio has surfaced online.
[Verse 1]
Shooting star flew across the sky
A light turned on in the barn
Nine-year-old boy and a stream of joy
Just sitting there trying to keep warm
A soon-to-be-mama quarter horse
Looked up at the sky
Then came a foal and he set a goal
Then tears came to his eyes

[Chorus]
Little boys, they dream big dreams
And some just might come true
And if he rides, that young foal's strides
Are bound to take him to...
He’s going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse you ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Houston rodeo

[Verse 2]
Every night, that boy would ride on that horse in moonlight
Black and white, he was a bumpy ride
But that boy was gonna make him right
Through heat and snow, they rode and rode
Soon they were best friends
By light of dawn, they were always gone
Following trails that never end


[Chorus]
Little boys, they dream big dreams
And some, they have to come true
If he rides that yearling's strides
Are bound to take him to...
He’s going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse he'll ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Houston rodeo

[Bridge]
And when he was a teen
Made it to the rodeo
And as the gate released
He took on the Houston rodeo

[Reprise]
He's going to the Houston rodeo
Ooh, on that horse he'll ride
Put on his daddy's cowboy hat
With a little Texas town pride
Oh, that boy, he's gonna ride
Houston rodeo, oh"

Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)

Payback is a bad chick
And baby, I'm the baddest
You messin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this (Oh)
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but no

[Break Free: Katherine]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Scared to Be Lonely: Lisa]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is thе only reason you're holding me tonight
'Causе we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely?
(Scared to be lonely?)

[Blank Space: Amy, Lauren]
Nice to meet ya, where ya been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven sent
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my gosh, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Woah
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Dark Horse: Katherine, Lisa]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[We Found Love: Katherine]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

[You Say: Lauren]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours

[You Say/Halo: Katherine, Lauren]
And I believe
I can see your halo
Oh, I believe
I can see your halo
What You say of me
I can see your halo
I believe


[Halo: Amy, Lisa]
I can see your halo
Everywhere I'm lookin' now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my savin' grace

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kind of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you come in my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
You live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love

You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"

One-Sided Goodbye Lyrics
“One-Sided Goodbye” was featured on a 2003 demo CD, which was shared by Brian Mansfield via Instagram in November 2018. As of October 2019, no audio has surfaced online.
[Verse 1]
You said it, then you walked away
But you don't know what goodbye means
Baby, I'm sorry, didn't ever mean to hurt you
Please, save it for a rainy day
'Cause you don't know what crying's like
When the world keeps spinning and I can't take it alone

[Pre-Chorus]
And you're so different from all those other people
I thought it would be different with you
But I can't see you crying without me
So I guess I'll have to make it through without you

[Chorus]
I wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
You walked around like you loved me, I
Notice how the world tries to mask that word
""See you later,"" ""gotta go,"" oh no

[Verse 2]
I don't care what they would say
If you love someone don't let them go
Do you believe in taking chances?
So tell me why you walked away
'Cause I can't see through your heart
Everything's hazy and you're making me crazy for you


[Pre-Chorus]
Well, I thought you were different
Maybe I'm crazy
I know I wasn't numb with you
But I can't hear you crying without me
So I guess I'll have to make it through without you

[Chorus]
I wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
You walked around like you loved me, I
Notice how the world tries to mask that word
""See you later,"" ""gotta go""

[Bridge]
Why can't you see, why can't you be
Madly in love with me, too?
Past emotion, but you've already spoken
I guess I'll have to make it through without you

[Chorus]
I wasn't ready for your one-sided goodbye
You walked around like you loved me, I
Notice how the world tries to mask that word
""See you later,"" ""gotta go"", oh no"

Taylor Swift on Sexism, Scrutiny, and Standing Up for Herself Lyrics
IT’S A SUNDAY AFTERNOON in Tribeca, and I’m in Taylor Swift’s loft, inside a former printing house that she has restored and fortified into a sanctuary of brick, velvet, and mahogany. The space is warm and cozy and vaguely literary—later, when we pass through her bedroom en route to her garden, 10 percent of my brain will believe her wardrobe might open up to Narnia. Barefoot in a wine-colored floral top and matching flowy pants, Swift is typing passwords into a laptop to show me the video for “You Need to Calm Down,” eight days before she unleashes it on the world.


I have a sliver of an idea what to expect. A few weeks earlier, I spent a day at the video shoot, in a dusty field-slash-junkyard north of Los Angeles. Swift had made it a sort of Big Gay Candy Mountain trailer park, a Technicolor happy place. The cast and crew wore heart-shaped sunglasses—living, breathing lovey-eyes emoji
—and a mailbox warned, LOVE LETTERS ONLY.

Swift and a stream of costars filmed six scenes over about a dozen hours. The singer-songwriter Hayley Kiyoko, known to her fans as “Lesbian Jesus,” shot arrows at a bull’s-eye.
 The YouTube comedian-chef Hannah Hart danced alongside Dexter Mayfield, the plus-size male model and self-described “big boy in heels.” The Olympic figure skater Adam Rippon served up icy red snow cones. Swift and her close friend Todrick Hall, of Kinky Boots and RuPaul’s Drag Race, sipped tea with the cast of Queer Eye.

The mood was joyous and laid-back. But by the end of the day, I wasn’t sure what the vignettes would add up to. There were shoot days and cameos I wouldn’t observe. For security reasons, the song was never played aloud. (The cast wore ear buds.) Even the hero shot, in which Swift and Hall sauntered arm in arm through the dreamscape at golden hour, was filmed in near-total silence.


For weeks afterward, I tried to sleuth out a theory. I started casually. There was a “5” on the bull’s-eye, so I did a quick search to figure out what that number might mean. Immediately I was in over my head.


Swift has a thing for symbols. I knew she had been embedding secret messages in liner notes and deploying metaphors as refrains since her self-titled debut in 2006—long before her megafame made her into a symbol of pop supremacy. But I hadn’t understood how coded and byzantine her body of work has become; I hadn’t learned, as Swift’s fans have, to see hidden meanings everywhere. For instance: In the 2017 video for “Look What You Made Me Do,” a headstone in a graveyard scene reads NILS SJOBERG, the pseudonym Swift used as her writing credit on Rihanna’s hit “This Is What You Came For,” a Swedish-sounding nod to that country’s pop wizards.


After an excessive amount of ad hoc scholarship—a friend joked that I could have learned Mandarin in the time I spent trying to unpack Swift’s oeuvre—I was no closer to a theory. Pop music has become so layered and meta, but the Taylor Swift Universe stands apart. Apprehending it is like grasping quantum physics.

My first indication of what her new album, Lover, would be about came just after midnight on June 1, the beginning of Pride Month, when Swift introduced a petition in support of the federal Equality Act. This legislation would amend the Civil Rights Act to outlaw discrimination based on gender identity and sexual orientation. (It has passed the House, but prospects in Mitch McConnell’s Senate are unclear.) Swift also posted a letter to Senator Lamar Alexander, Republican of Tennessee, asking him to vote yes. The request, on her personal letterhead (born in 1989. LOVES CATS.), denounced President Trump for not supporting the Equality Act. “I personally reject the president’s stance,” Swift wrote.

Back in the kitchen, Swift hits play. “The first verse is about trolls and cancel culture,” she says.
 “The second verse is about homophobes and the people picketing outside our concerts.
 The third verse is about successful women being pitted against each other.”


The video is, for erudite Swifties, a rich text. I had followed enough clues to correctly guess some of the other cameos—Ellen DeGeneres,
 RuPaul, Katy Perry. I felt the satisfaction of a gamer who successfully levels up—achievement unlocked! The video’s final frame sends viewers to Swift’s change.org petition in support of the Equality Act, which has acquired more than 400,000 signatures—including those of Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Beto O’Rourke, and Kirsten Gillibrand—or four times the number required to elicit an official response from the White House.

“Maybe a year or two ago, Todrick and I are in the car, and he asked me, What would you do if your son was gay?”

We are upstairs in Swift’s secret garden, comfortably ensconced in a human-scale basket that is sort of shaped like a cocoon. Swift has brought up an ornate charcuterie board and is happily slathering triple-cream Brie onto sea-salt crackers. “The fact that he had to ask me . . . shocked me and made me realize that I had not made my position clear enough or loud enough,” she says.
 “If my son was gay, he’d be gay. I don’t understand the question.”

I have pressed Swift on this topic, and her answers have been direct, not performative or scripted. I do sense that she enjoys talking to me about as much as she’d enjoy a root canal—but she’s unfailingly polite, and when we turn to music, her face will light up and she will add little melodic phrases to her speech, clearly her preferred language.


If he was thinking that, I can’t imagine what my fans in the LGBTQ community might be thinking,” she goes on. “It was kind of devastating to realize that I hadn’t been publicly clear about that.”

I understand why she was surprised; she has been sending pro-LGBTQ signals since at least 2011. Many have been subtle, but none insignificant—especially for a young country star coming out of Nashville.

In the video for her single “Mean” (from 2010’s Speak Now), we see a boy in a school locker room wearing a lavender sweater and bow tie, surrounded by football players.
 In “Welcome to New York,” the first track on 1989, she sings, “And you can want who you want. Boys and boys and girls and girls.” Two years later, she donated to a fund for the newly created Stonewall National Monument and presented Ruby Rose with a GLAAD Media Award. Every night of last year’s Reputation tour, she dedicated the song “Dress” to Loie Fuller, the openly gay pioneer of modern dance and theatrical lighting who captured the imagination of fin-de-siècle Paris.


Swift, who has been criticized for keeping her politics to herself, first took an explicit stance a month before the 2018 midterms. On Instagram, she endorsed Democrats for the Tennessee Legislature and called out the Republican running for Senate, Marsha Blackburn. “She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples,” Swift wrote. “She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values.”


Swift says the post was partly to help young fans understand that if they wanted to vote, they had to register. To tell them, as she puts it, “Hey, just so you know, you can’t just roll up.” Some 65,000 new voters registered in the first 24 hours after her post, according to Vote.org.

Trump came to Blackburn’s defense the following day. “She’s a tremendous woman,” he told reporters. “I’m sure Taylor Swift doesn’t know anything about her. Let’s say I like Taylor’s music about 25 percent less now, OK?”

In April, spurred by a raft of anti-LGBTQ bills in Tennessee, Swift donated $113,000 to the Tennessee Equality Project, which advocates for LGBTQ rights. “Horrendous,” she says of the legislation. “They don’t call it ‘Slate of Hate’ for nothing.” Swift especially liked that the Tennessee Equality Project had organized a petition of faith leaders in opposition. “I loved how smart it was to come at it from a religious perspective.”


Meanwhile, the “Calm Down” video provoked a Colorado pastor to call Swift “a sinner in desperate need of a savior” and warn that “God will cut her down.” It also revived heated debate within LGBTQ communities about the politics of allyship and corporatization of Pride. Some critics argued Swift’s pro-LGBTQ imagery and lyrics were overdue and out of the blue—a reaction the new Swift scholar in me found bewildering. Had they not been paying attention?

Nor did it strike me as out of character for Swift to leverage her power for a cause. She pulled her catalog from Spotify in 2014 over questions of artist compensation. She stared down Apple in 2015, when the company said it would not pay artists during the launch of its music service. (Apple reversed itself immediately.)
 As a condition of her record deal with Universal Music Group last year, the company promised that it would distribute proceeds from any sale of its Spotify shares to all of its artists. And this summer, Swift furiously called out Scott Borchetta, founder of Big Machine Label Group, for selling her master recordings to the music manager Scooter Braun. (When I ask Swift if she tried to get her masters from Big Machine, her whole body slumps with a palpable heaviness. “It was either investing in my past or my and other artists’ future, and I chose the future,” she says of the deal she struck with Universal.)


Swift’s blunt testimony during her 2017 sexual-assault case against a radio DJ—months before the #MeToo reckoning blew open—felt deeply political to me and, I imagine, many other women. Swift accused the DJ, David Mueller, of groping her under her skirt at a photo session in 2013. Her camp reported the incident to his employer, who fired him. Mueller denied the allegation, sued Swift for $3 million, and his case was thrown out. Swift countersued for a symbolic $1 and won.

In a Colorado courtroom, Swift described the incident: “He stayed latched onto my bare ass cheek” as photos were being snapped. Asked why photos of the front of her skirt didn’t show this, she said, “Because my ass is located at the back of my body.” Asked if she felt bad about the DJ’s losing his job, she said, “I’m not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault. Here we are years later, and I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are the product of his decisions—not mine.”

When Time included Swift on the cover of its “Silence Breakers” issue that year, the magazine asked how she felt during the testimony. “I was angry,” she said. “In that moment, I decided to forgo any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened...I’m told it was the most amount of times the word ass has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.”

Mueller has since paid Swift the dollar—with a Sacagawea coin. “He was trolling me, implying that I was self-righteous and hell-bent on angry, vengeful feminism. That’s what I’m inferring from him giving me a Sacagawea coin,” Swift says. “Hey, maybe he was trying to do it in honor of a powerful Native American woman. I didn’t ask.” Where is the coin now? “My lawyer has it.”


I ask her, why get louder about LGBTQ rights now? “Rights are being stripped from basically everyone who isn’t a straight white cisgender male,” she says. “I didn’t realize until recently that I could advocate for a community that I’m not a part of. It’s hard to know how to do that without being so fearful of making a mistake that you just freeze. Because my mistakes are very loud. When I make a mistake, it echoes through the canyons of the world. It’s clickbait, and it’s a part of my life story, and it’s a part of my career arc.”

I’d argue that no heterosexual woman can listen to “You Need to Calm Down” and hear only a gay anthem. “Calm down” is what controlling men tell women who are angry, contrary, or “hysterical,” or, let’s say, fearing for their physical safety. It is what Panic! at the Disco singer Brendon Urie says to Swift in the beginning of the “ME!” music video, prompting her to scream, “Je suis calme!”

I cannot believe it is a coincidence that Swift, a numbers geek with an affinity for dates, dropped the single—whose slow, incessant bass is likely to be bumping in stadiums across the world in 2020 if she goes on tour—on June 14, a certain president’s birthday.

It’s enlightening to read 13 years of Taylor Swift coverage—all the big reviews, all the big profiles—in one sitting. You notice things.

How quickly Swift went from a “prodigy” (The New Yorker) and a “songwriting savant” (Rolling Stone) to a tabloid fixture, for instance. Or how suspect her ambition is made to seem once she acquires real power.

Other plot points simply look different in the light of #MeToo. It is hard to imagine that Swift’s songs about her exes would be reviewed as sensationally today. I wonder if, in 2019, any man would dare grab the microphone out of a young woman’s hands at an awards show.
 I stared into space for a good long while when I was reminded that Pitchfork did not review Taylor Swift’s 1989 but did review Ryan Adams’s cover album of Taylor Swift’s 1989.


I ask Swift if she had always been aware of sexism. “I think about this a lot,” she says. “When I was a teenager, I would hear people talk about sexism in the music industry, and I’d be like, I don’t see it. I don’t understand. Then I realized that was because I was a kid. Men in the industry saw me as a kid. I was a lanky, scrawny, overexcited young girl who reminded them more of their little niece or their daughter than a successful woman in business or a colleague. The second I became a woman, in people’s perception, was when I started seeing it.

“It’s fine to infantilize a girl’s success and say, How cute that she’s having some hit songs,” she goes on. “How cute that she’s writing songs. But the second it becomes formidable? As soon as I started playing stadiums—when I started to look like a woman—that wasn’t as cool anymore.
 It was when I started to have songs from Red come out and cross over, like ‘I Knew You Were Trouble’ and ‘We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together.’ ”

Those songs are also more assertive than the ones that came before, I say. “Yeah, the angle was different when I started saying, I knew you were trouble when you walked in. Basically, you emotionally manipulated me and I didn’t love it. That wasn’t fun for me.”

I have to wonder if having her songwriting overlooked as her hits were picked apart and scrutinized wasn’t the biggest bummer of all. Swift: “I wanted to say to people, You realize writing songs is an art and a craft and not, like, an easy thing to do? Or to do well? People would act like it was a weapon I was using. Like a cheap dirty trick. Be careful, bro, she’ll write a song about you. Don’t stand near her. First of all, that’s not how it works.
 Second of all, find me a time when they say that about a male artist: Be careful, girl, he’ll use his experience with you to get—God forbid—inspiration to make art.”


Without question the tenor of the Taylor Swift Narrative changed most dramatically in July 2016, when Kim Kardashian West called her a “snake” on Twitter, and released video clips of Swift and Kanye West discussing the lyrics to his song “Famous.” (No need to rehash the details here. Suffice it to say that Swift’s version of events hasn’t changed: She knew about some of the lyrics but not others; specifically, the words that bitch.) The posts sparked several hashtags, including #TaylorSwiftIsASnake and #TaylorSwiftIsCanceled, which quickly escalated into a months-long campaign to “cancel” Swift.

To this day Swift doesn’t think people grasp the repercussions of that term. “A mass public shaming, with millions of people saying you are quote-unquote canceled, is a very isolating experience,” she says. “I don’t think there are that many people who can actually understand what it’s like to have millions of people hate you very loudly.” She adds: “When you say someone is canceled, it’s not a TV show. It’s a human being. You’re sending mass amounts of messaging to this person to either shut up, disappear, or it could also be perceived as, Kill yourself.”

An overhaul was in order. “I realized I needed to restructure my life because it felt completely out of control,” Swift says. “I knew immediately I needed to make music about it because I knew it was the only way I could survive it. It was the only way I could preserve my mental health and also tell the story of what it’s like to go through something so humiliating.”


I get a sense of the whiplash Swift experienced when I notice that, a few months into this ordeal, while she was writing the songs that an interpolation of a ’90s camp classic, Right Said Fred’s “I’m Too Sexy.”) Nonetheless, most critics read it as a grenade lobbed in the general direction of Calabasas.

One longtime Nashville critic, Brian Mansfield, had a more plausible take: She was writing sarcastically as the “Taylor Swift” portrayed in the media in a bid for privacy. “Yeah, this is the character you created for me, let me just hide behind it,” she says now of the persona she created. “I always used this metaphor when I was younger. I’d say that with every reinvention, I never wanted to tear down my house. ’Cause I built this house. This house being, metaphorically, my body of work, my songwriting, my music, my catalog, my library. I just wanted to redecorate. I think a lot of people, with Reputation, would have perceived that I had torn down the house. Actually, I just built a bunker around it.”


In March, the snakes started to morph into butterflies, the vampire color palette into Easter pastels. When a superbloom of wildflowers lured a mesmerizing deluge of Painted Lady butterflies to Los Angeles, Swift marked it with an Instagram post. She attended the iHeartRadio Music Awards that night in a sequin romper and stilettos with shimmery wings attached.


Swift announced the single “ME!” a month later, with a large butterfly mural in Nashville.
 In the music video for the (conspicuously) bubblegum song, a hissing pastel-pink snake explodes into a kaleidoscope of butterflies. One flutters by the window of an apartment, where Swift is arguing in French with Urie.
 A record player is playing in the background. “It’s an old-timey, 1940s-sounding instrumental version of ‘You Need to Calm Down,’ ’’ Swift says.
 Later, in the “Calm Down” video, Swift wears a (fake) back tattoo of a snake swarmed by butterflies.


We are only two songs in, people. Lover, to be released on August 23, will have a total of 18 songs. “I was compiling ideas for a very long time,” Swift says. “When I started writing, I couldn’t stop.”
 (We can assume the British actor Joe Alwyn, with whom Swift has been in a relationship for nearly three years, provided some of the inspiration.)

Swift thinks Lover might be her favorite album yet. “There are so many ways in which this album feels like a new beginning,” she says. “This album is really a love letter to love, in all of its maddening, passionate, exciting, enchanting, horrific, tragic, wonderful glory.”

I have to ask Swift, given how genuinely at peace she seems, if part of her isn’t thankful, if not for the Great Cancellation of 2016, then for the person she now is—knowing who her friends are, knowing what’s what. “When you’re going through loss or embarrassment or shame, it’s a grieving process with so many micro emotions in a day. One of the reasons why I didn’t do interviews for Reputation was that I couldn’t figure out how I felt hour to hour. Sometimes I felt like: All these things taught me something that I never could have learned in a way that didn’t hurt as much. Five minutes later, I’d feel like: That was horrible. Why did that have to happen? What am I supposed to take from this other than mass amounts of humiliation? And then five minutes later I’d think: I think I might be happier than I’ve ever been.”

She goes on: “It’s so strange trying to be self-aware when you’ve been cast as this always smiling, always happy ‘America’s sweetheart’ thing, and then having that taken away and realizing that it’s actually a great thing that it was taken away, because that’s extremely limiting.” Swift leans back in the cocoon and smiles: “We’re not going to go straight to gratitude with it. Ever. But we’re going to find positive aspects to it. We’re never going to write a thank-you note.”

Though people will take the Perry-Swift burger-and-fries embrace in the “You Need to Calm Down” video as a press release that the two have mended fences, Swift says it’s actually a comment on how the media pits female pop stars against one another. After Perry sent Swift an (actual) olive branch last year, Swift asked her to be in the video: “She wrote back, This makes me so emotional. I’m so up for this. I want us to be that example. But let’s spend some time together. Because I want it to be real. So she came over and we talked for hours.


“We decided the metaphor for what happens in the media,” Swift explains, “is they pick two people and it’s like they’re pouring gasoline all over the floor. All that needs to happen is one false move, one false word, one misunderstanding, and a match is lit and dropped. That’s what happened with us. It was: Who’s better? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? Katy or Taylor? The tension is so high that it becomes impossible for you to not think that the other person has something against you.""

Meanwhile, the protesters in the video reference a real-life religious group that pickets outside Swift’s concerts, not the white working class in general, as some have assumed. “So many artists have them at their shows, and it’s such a confounding, confusing, infuriating thing to have outside of joyful concerts,” she tells me. “Obviously I don’t want to mention the actual entity, because they would get excited about that. Giving them press is not on my list of priorities.”


At one point, Swift asks if I would like to hear two other songs off the new album. (Duh.) First she plays “Lover,” the title track, coproduced by Jack Antonoff. “This has one of my favorite bridges,” she says. “I love a bridge, and I was really able to go to Bridge City.”
 It’s a romantic, haunting, waltzy, singer-songwritery nugget: classic Swift. “My heart’s been borrowed and yours has been blue,” she sings. “All’s well that ends well to end up with you.”


Next, Swift cues up a track that “plays with the idea of perception.” She has often wondered how she would be written and spoken about if she were a man, “so I wrote a song called ‘The Man.’ ” It’s a thought experiment of sorts: “If I had made all the same choices, all the same mistakes, all the same accomplishments, how would it read?” Seconds later, Swift’s earpods are pumping a synth-pop earworm into my head: “I’d be a fearless leader. I’d be an alpha type. When everyone believes ya: What’s that like?”

Swift wrote the first two singles with Joel Little, best known as one of Lorde’s go-to producers. (“From a pop-songwriting point of view, she’s the pinnacle,” Little says of Swift.) The album is likely to include more marquee names. A portrait of the Dixie Chicks in the background of the “ME!” video almost certainly portends a collaboration.
 If fans are correctly reading a button affixed to her denim jacket in a recent magazine cover, we can expect one with Drake, too.


Speaking of: Inquiring fans will want to know if Swift dropped any more clues about how to decode Lover during this interview. For you I reviewed the audio again, and there were a few things that made my newly acquired Swifty sense tingle.

At one point she compared superstardom in the digital age to life in a dollhouse, one where voyeurs “can ‘ship’ you with who they want to ‘ship’ you with, and they can ‘favorite’ friends that you have, and they can know where you are all the time.” The metaphor was precise and vivid and, well, a little too intricately rendered to be off the cuff. (Also, the “ME!” lyric: “Baby doll, when it comes to a lover. I promise that you’ll never find another like me.”)

Then there was the balloon—a giant gold balloon in the shape of a numeral seven that happened to float by while we were on her roof, on this, the occasion of her seventh album. “Is it an L’?” I say. “No, because look, the string is hanging from the bottom,” she says.

It might seem an obvious symbolic gesture, deployed for this interview, except for how impossible that seems. Swift let me control the timing of nearly everything. Moreover, the gold seven wasn’t floating up from the sidewalk below. It was already high in the sky, drifting slowly toward us from down the street. She would have had to control the wind, or at least to have studied it. Would Taylor Swift really go to such elaborate lengths for her fans? This much I know: Yes, she would."

Anti-Hero (Jayda G Remix) Lyrics
[Intro]
It's me, hi
It's me, hi

[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tirеd of my scheming


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problеm, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Post-Chorus]
It's me, hi
It's me, hi


[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Post-Chorus]
It's me, hi
It's me, hi

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Post-Chorus]
It's me, hi
It's me, hi

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Post-Chorus]
It's me, hi
It's me, hi

[Outro]
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Picture To Burn (Commentary) Lyrics
Becca: This is Big Machine Radio and we're celebrating the twelve-year anniversary of Taylor Swift's debut album, also called Taylor Swift, which she released back in October of 2006. We're playing all of the songs on the album, going back and hearing from Taylor at that time. And, y'know, Taylor will never forget a faithful meeting with Scott Borchetta after she's just finished playing at the Bluebird Cafe here in Nashville

Taylor Swift: He came up to me after the show and was, likе, ""Um, I'm working on something and I want you to be a part of it, but I can't talk to you about it right now"" and what that meant was that hе was still at Universal Records. He was MVP
 at Universal Records and what that meant was that he was starting off
 a brand new label and wanted me to be on it. So, that label turned out to be Big Machine Records

Becca: We here at Big Machine could not be prouder of Taylor and everything that she has gone on to accomplish since she released her debut album back in 2006. And I'm sure you've heard this song from Taylor, it's ""Picture To Burn"" on Big Machine Radio"

Question...? (Clean) Lyrics
[Intro]
I remember

[Verse 1]
Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices
We had one thing goin' on
I swear that it was somethin'
'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since
But one thing after another
Lost in situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations

[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question


[Verse 2]
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some meathead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Lost in politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation

[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question

[Bridge]
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight


[Chorus]
Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you)
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do? (Do)
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh (More of a fight)
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question"

October 2019 Cover: Taylor Swift Lyrics
This page is an annotated version of Swift’s October 2019 Rolling Stone interview.
Taylor Swift bursts into her mom’s Nashville kitchen, smiling, looking remarkably like Taylor Swift. (That red-lip, classic thing
? Check.) “I need someone to help dye my hair pink,” she says, and moments later, her ends match her sparkly nail polish, sneakers, and the stripes on her button-down.
 It’s all in keeping with the pastel aesthetic of her new album, Lover; black-leather combat-Taylor from her previous album cycle has handed back the phone.
 Around the black-granite kitchen island, all is calm and normal, as Swift’s mom, dad, and younger brother pass through. Her mom’s two dogs, one very small, one very large, pounce upon visitors with slurping glee. It could be any 29-year-old’s weekend visit with her parents, if not for the madness looming a few feet down the hall.

In an airy terrace, 113 giddy, weepy, shaky, still-in-disbelief fans are waiting for the start of one of Swift’s secret sessions, sacred rituals in Swift-dom. She’s about to play them her seventh album, as-yet unreleased on this Sunday afternoon in early August, and offer copious commentary. Also, she made cookies.
 Just before the session, Swift sits down in her mom’s study (where she “operates the Google,” per her daughter) to chat for a few minutes. The black-walled room is decorated with black-and-white classic-rock photos, including shots of Bruce Springsteen
 and, unsurprisingly, James Taylor
; there are also more recent shots of Swift posing with Kris Kristofferson and playing with Def Leppard
, her mom’s favorite band.

In a corner is an acoustic guitar Swift played as a teenager. She almost certainly wrote some well-known songs on it, but can’t recall which ones. “It would be kind of weird to finish a song and be like, ‘And this moment, I shall remember,’'” she says, laughing. “‘This guitar hath been anointed with my sacred tuneage!'”

The secret session itself is, as the name suggests, deeply off-the-record; it can be confirmed that she drank some white wine, since her glass pops up in some Instagram pictures. She stays until 5 a.m., chatting and taking photos with every one of the fans.
 Five hours later, we continue our talk at length in Swift’s Nashville condo, in almost exactly the same spot where we did one of our interviews for her 2012 Rolling Stone cover story. She’s hardly changed its whimsical decor in the past seven years (one of the few additions is a pool table replacing the couch where we sat last time), so it’s an old-Taylor time capsule. There’s still a huge bunny made of moss in one corner, and a human-size birdcage in the living room, though the view from the latter is now of generic new condo buildings instead of just distant green hills. Swift is barefoot now, in pale-blue jeans and a blue button-down tied at the waist; her hair is pulled back, her makeup minimal.

How to sum up the past three years of Taylor Swift? In July 2016, after Swift expressed discontent with Kanye West’s “Famous,” Kim Kardashian did her best to destroy her, unleashing clandestine recordings of a phone conversation between Swift and West. In the piecemeal audio, Swift can be heard agreeing to the line “…me and Taylor might still have sex.” We don’t hear her learning about the next lyric, the one she says bothered her — “I made that bitch famous” — and as she’ll explain, there’s more to her side of the story. The backlash was, well, swift, and overwhelming. It still hasn’t altogether subsided. Later that year, Swift chose not to make an endorsement in the 2016 election, which definitely didn’t help. In the face of it all, she made Reputation — fierce, witty, almost-industrial pop offset by love songs of crystalline beauty — and had a wildly successful stadium tour. Somewhere in there, she met her current boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, and judging by certain songs on Lover, the relationship is serious indeed.

Lover is Swift’s most adult album, a rebalancing of sound and persona that opens doors to the next decade of her career; it’s also a welcome return to the sonic diversity of 2012’s Red, with tracks ranging from the St. Vincent-assisted über-bop “Cruel Summer” to the unbearably poignant country-fied “Soon You’ll Get Better” (with the Dixie Chicks)
 and the “Shake It Off”-worthy pep of “Paper Rings.”


She wants to talk about the music, of course, but she is also ready to explain the past three years of her life, in depth, for the first time. The conversation is often not a light one. She’s built up more armor in the past few years, but still has the opposite of a poker face — you can see every micro-emotion wash over her as she ponders a question, her nose wrinkling in semi-ironic offense at the term “old-school pop stars,” her preposterously blue eyes glistening as she turns to darker subjects. In her worst moments, she says, “You feel like you’re being completely pulled into a riptide. So what are you going to do? Splash a lot? Or hold your breath and hope you somehow resurface? And that’s what I did. And it took three years. Sitting here doing an interview — the fact that we’ve done an interview before is the only reason I’m not in a full body sweat.”

When we talked seven years ago, everything was going so well for you, and you were very worried that something would go wrong.

Yeah, I kind of knew it would. I felt like I was walking along the sidewalk, knowing eventually the pavement was going to crumble and I was gonna fall through. You can’t keep winning and have people like it. People love “new” so much — they raise you up the flagpole, and you’re waving at the top of the flagpole for a while. And then they’re like, “Wait, this new flag is what we actually love.”
 They decide something you’re doing is incorrect, that you’re not standing for what you should stand for. You’re a bad example. Then if you keep making music and you survive, and you keep connecting with people, eventually they raise you a little bit up the flagpole again, and then they take you back down, and back up again. And it happens to women more than it happens to men in music.

It also happened to you a few times on a smaller scale, didn’t it?

I’ve had several upheavals in my career. When I was 18, they were like, “She doesn’t really write those songs.” So my third album I wrote by myself as a reaction to that.
 Then they decided I was a serial dater — a boy-crazy man-eater — when I was 22.
 And so I didn’t date anyone for, like, two years. And then they decided in 2016 that absolutely everything about me was wrong. If I did something good, it was for the wrong reasons. If I did something brave, I didn’t do it correctly. If I stood up for myself, I was throwing a tantrum. And so I found myself in this endless mockery echo chamber. It’s just like — I have a brother who’s two and a half years younger, and we spent the first half of our lives trying to kill each other and the second half as best friends. You know that game kids play? I’d be like, “Mom, can I have some water?” And Austin would be like, “Mom, can I have some water?” And I’m like, “He’s copying me.” And he’d be like, “He’s copying me.” Always in a really obnoxious voice that sounds all twisted. That’s what it felt like in 2016. So I decided to just say nothing. It wasn’t really a decision. It was completely involuntary.

But you also had good things happen in your life at the same time — that’s part of Reputation.

The moments of my true story on that album are songs like “Delicate,” “New Year’s Day,” “Call It What You Want,” “Dress.” The one-two punch, bait-and-switch of Reputation is that it was actually a love story. It was a love story in amongst chaos. All the weaponized sort of metallic battle anthems were what was going on outside. That was the battle raging on that I could see from the windows, and then there was what was happening inside my world — my newly quiet, cozy world that was happening on my own terms for the first time. . . . It’s weird, because in some of the worst times of my career, and reputation, dare I say, I had some of the most beautiful times — in my quiet life that I chose to have. And I had some of the most incredible memories with the friends I now knew cared about me, even if everyone hated me. The bad stuff was really significant and damaging. But the good stuff will endure. The good lessons — you realize that you can’t just show your life to people.


Meaning?
I used to be like a golden retriever, just walking up to everybody, like, wagging my tail. “Sure, yeah, of course! What do you want to know? What do you need?” Now, I guess, I have to be a little bit more like a fox.

Do your regrets on that extend to the way the “girl squad” thing was perceived?

Yeah, I never would have imagined that people would have thought, “This is a clique that wouldn’t have accepted me if I wanted to be in it.” Holy shit, that hit me like a ton of bricks. I was like, “Oh, this did not go the way that I thought it was going to go.” I thought it was going to be we can still stick together, just like men are allowed to do. The patriarchy allows men to have bro packs. If you’re a male artist, there’s an understanding that you have respect for your counterparts.

Whereas women are expected to be feuding with each other?

It’s assumed that we hate each other. Even if we’re smiling and photographed together with our arms around each other, it’s assumed there’s a knife in our pocket.

How much of a danger was there of falling into that thought pattern yourself?

The messaging is dangerous, yes. Nobody is immune, because we’re a product of what society and peer groups and now the internet tells us, unless we learn differently from experience.

You once sang about a star who “took the money and your dignity, and got the hell out.”
 In 2016, you wrote in your journal, “This summer is the apocalypse.”
 How close did you come to quitting altogether?

I definitely thought about that a lot. I thought about how words are my only way of making sense of the world and expressing myself — and now any words I say or write are being twisted against me. People love a hate frenzy. It’s like piranhas. People had so much fun hating me, and they didn’t really need very many reasons to do it. I felt like the situation was pretty hopeless. I wrote a lot of really aggressively bitter poems constantly.
 I wrote a lot of think pieces that I knew I’d never publish, about what it’s like to feel like you’re in a shame spiral. And I couldn’t figure out how to learn from it. Because I wasn’t sure exactly what I did that was so wrong. That was really hard for me, because I cannot stand it when people can’t take criticism. So I try to self-examine, and even though that’s really hard and hurts a lot sometimes, I really try to understand where people are coming from when they don’t like me. And I completely get why people wouldn’t like me. Because, you know, I’ve had my insecurities say those things — and things 1,000 times worse.

But some of your former critics have become your friends, right?

Some of my best friendships came from people publicly criticizing me and then it opening up a conversation. Hayley Kiyoko was doing an interview and she made an example about how I get away with singing about straight relationships and people don’t give me shit the way they give her shit for singing about girls — and it’s totally valid.
 Like, Ella — Lorde — the first thing she ever said about me publicly was a criticism of my image or whatever.
 But I can’t really respond to someone saying, “You, as a human being, are fake.”
 And if they say you’re playing the victim, that completely undermines your ability to ever verbalize how you feel unless it’s positive.
 So, OK, should I just smile all the time and never say anything hurts me? Because that’s really fake. Or should I be real about how I’m feeling and have valid, legitimate responses to things that happened to me in my life? But wait, would that be playing the victim?

How do you escape that mental trap?

Since I was 15 years old, if people criticized me for something, I changed it. So you realize you might be this amalgamation of criticisms that were hurled at you, and not an actual person who’s made any of these choices themselves. And so I decided I needed to live a quiet life, because a quiet personal life invites no discussion, dissection, and debate. I didn’t realize I was inviting people to feel they had the right to sort of play my life like a video game.


“The old Taylor can’t come to the phone right now. Why? Because she’s dead!” was funny — but how seriously should we take it?

There’s a part of me that definitely is always going to be different. I needed to grow up in many ways. I needed to make boundaries, to figure out what was mine and what was the public’s. That old version of me that shares unfailingly and unblinkingly with a world that is probably not fit to be shared with? I think that’s gone. But it was definitely just, like, a fun moment in the studio with me and Jack [Antonoff] where I wanted to play on the idea of a phone call — because that’s how all of this started, a stupid phone call I shouldn’t have picked up.

It would have been much easier if that’s what you’d just said.
It would have been so, so great if I would have just said that [laughs].

Some of the Lover iconography does suggest old Taylor’s return, though.
I don’t think I’ve ever leaned into the old version of myself more creatively than I have on this album, where it’s very, very autobiographical. But also moments of extreme catchiness and moments of extreme personal confession.

Did you do anything wrong from your perspective in dealing with that phone call? Is there anything you regret?

The world didn’t understand the context and the events that led up to it. Because nothing ever just happens like that without some lead-up. Some events took place to cause me to be pissed off when he called me a bitch. That was not just a singular event. Basically, I got really sick of the dynamic between he and I. And that wasn’t just based on what happened on that phone call and with that song — it was kind of a chain reaction of things.

I started to feel like we reconnected, which felt great for me — because all I ever wanted my whole career after that thing happened in 2009 was for him to respect me. When someone doesn’t respect you so loudly and says you literally don’t deserve to be here — I just so badly wanted that respect from him, and I hate that about myself, that I was like, “This guy who’s antagonizing me, I just want his approval.” But that’s where I was. And so we’d go to dinner and stuff. And I was so happy, because he would say really nice things about my music. It just felt like I was healing some childhood rejection or something from when I was 19. But the 2015 VMAs come around. He’s getting the Vanguard Award. He called me up beforehand — I didn’t illegally record it, so I can’t play it for you. But he called me up, maybe a week or so before the event, and we had maybe over an hourlong conversation, and he’s like, “I really, really would like for you to present this Vanguard Award to me, this would mean so much to me,” and went into all the reasons why it means so much, because he can be so sweet. He can be the sweetest. And I was so stoked that he asked me that. And so I wrote this speech up, and then we get to the VMAs and I make this speech and he screams, “MTV got Taylor Swift up here to present me this award for ratings!” [His exact words: “You know how many times they announced Taylor was going to give me the award ’cause it got them more ratings?”] And I’m standing in the audience with my arm around his wife, and this chill ran through my body. I realized he is so two-faced. That he wants to be nice to me behind the scenes, but then he wants to look cool, get up in front of everyone and talk shit. And I was so upset. He wanted me to come talk to him after the event in his dressing room. I wouldn’t go. So then he sent this big, big thing of flowers the next day to apologize.
 And I was like, “You know what? I really don’t want us to be on bad terms again. So whatever, I’m just going to move past this.” So when he gets on the phone with me, and I was so touched that he would be respectful and, like, tell me about this one line in the song.

The line being “. . . me and Taylor might still have sex”?

[Nods] And I was like, “OK, good. We’re back on good terms.” And then when I heard the song, I was like, “I’m done with this. If you want to be on bad terms, let’s be on bad terms, but just be real about it.”
 And then he literally did the same thing to Drake. He gravely affected the trajectory of Drake’s family and their lives. It’s the same thing. Getting close to you, earning your trust, detonating you. I really don’t want to talk about it anymore because I get worked up, and I don’t want to just talk about negative shit all day, but it’s the same thing. Go watch Drake talk about what happened. [West denied any involvement in Pusha-T’s revelation of Drake’s child and apologized for sending “negative energy” toward Drake.]

When did you get to the place that’s described on the opening track of Lover, “I Forgot That You Existed”?

It was sometime on the Reputation tour, which was the most transformative emotional experience of my career. That tour put me in the healthiest, most balanced place I’ve ever been. After that tour, bad stuff can happen to me, but it doesn’t level me anymore. The stuff that happened a couple of months ago with Scott [Borchetta] would have leveled me three years ago and silenced me. I would have been too afraid to speak up. Something about that tour made me disengage from some part of public perception I used to hang my entire identity on, which I now know is incredibly unhealthy.

What was the actual revelation?


It’s almost like I feel more clear about the fact that my job is to be an entertainer. It’s not like this massive thing that sometimes my brain makes it into, and sometimes the media makes it into, where we’re all on this battlefield and everyone’s gonna die except one person, who wins. It’s like, “No, do you know what? Katy is going to be legendary. Gaga is going to be legendary. Beyoncé is going to be legendary. Rihanna is going to be legendary. Because the work that they made completely overshadows the myopia of this 24-hour news cycle of clickbait.” And somehow I realized that on tour, as I was looking at people’s faces. We’re just entertaining people, and it’s supposed to be fun.

It’s interesting to look at these albums as a trilogy. 1989 was really a reset button.

Oh, in every way. I’ve been very vocal about the fact that that decision was mine and mine alone, and it was definitely met with a lot of resistance. Internally.


After realizing that things were not all smiles with your former label boss, Scott Borchetta, it’s hard not to wonder how much additional conflict there was over things like that.

A lot of the best things I ever did creatively were things that I had to really fight — and I mean aggressively fight — to have happen. But, you know, I’m not like him, making crazy, petty accusations about the past. . . . When you have a business relationship with someone for 15 years, there are going to be a lot of ups and a lot of downs. But I truly, legitimately thought he looked at me as the daughter he never had. And so even though we had a lot of really bad times and creative differences, I was going to hang my hat on the good stuff. I wanted to be friends with him. I thought I knew what betrayal felt like, but this stuff that happened with him was a redefinition of betrayal for me, just because it felt like it was family.
 To go from feeling like you’re being looked at as a daughter to this grotesque feeling of “Oh, I was actually his prized calf that he was fattening up to sell to the slaughterhouse that would pay the most.”

He accused you of declining the Parkland march and Manchester benefit show.

Unbelievable. Here’s the thing: Everyone in my team knew if Scooter Braun brings us something, do not bring it to me. The fact that those two are in business together after the things he said about Scooter Braun — it’s really hard to shock me. And this was utterly shocking. These are two very rich, very powerful men, using $300 million of other people’s money to purchase, like, the most feminine body of work. And then they’re standing in a wood-panel bar doing a tacky photo shoot, raising a glass of scotch to themselves.
 Because they pulled one over on me and got this done so sneakily that I didn’t even see it coming. And I couldn’t say anything about it.

In some ways, on a musical level, Lover feels like the most indie-ish of your albums.

That’s amazing, thank you. It’s definitely a quirky record. With this album, I felt like I sort of gave myself permission to revisit older themes that I used to write about, maybe look at them with fresh eyes. And to revisit older instruments — older in terms of when I used to use them. Because when I was making 1989, I was so obsessed with it being this concept of Eighties big pop, whether it was Eighties in its production or Eighties in its nature, just having these big choruses — being unapologetically big. And then reputation, there was a reason why I had it all in lowercase. I felt like it wasn’t unapologetically commercial. It’s weird, because that is the album that took the most amount of explanation, and yet it’s the one I didn’t talk about. In the reputation secret sessions I kind of had to explain to my fans, “I know we’re doing a new thing here that I’d never done before.” I’d never played with characters before. For a lot of pop stars, that’s a really fun trick, where they’re like, “This is my alter ego.” I had never played with that before. It’s really fun. And it was just so fun to play with on tour — the darkness and the bombast and the bitterness and the love and the ups and the downs of an emotional-turmoil record.

“Daylight” is a beautiful song. It feels like it could have been the title track.

It almost was. I thought it might be a little bit too sentimental.

And I guess maybe too on-the-nose.

Right, yeah, way too on-the-nose. That’s what I thought, because I was kind of in my head referring to the album as Daylight for a while. But Lover, to me, was a more interesting title, more of an accurate theme in my head, and more elastic as a concept. That’s why “You Need to Calm Down” can make sense within the theme of the album — one of the things it addresses is how certain people are not allowed to live their lives without discrimination just based on who they love.


For the more organic songs on this album, like “Lover” and “Paper Rings,” you said you were imagining a wedding band playing them. How often does that kind of visualization shape a song’s production style?

Sometimes I’ll have a strange sort of fantasy of where the songs would be played. And so for songs like “Paper Rings” or “Lover” I was imagining a wedding-reception band, but in the Seventies, so they couldn’t play instruments that wouldn’t have been invented yet. I have all these visuals. For reputation, it was nighttime cityscape. I didn’t really want any — or very minimal — traditional acoustic instruments. I imagined old warehouse buildings that had been deserted and factory spaces and all this industrial kind of imagery. So I wanted the production to have nothing wooden. There’s no wood floors on that album. Lover is, like, completely just a barn wood floor and some ripped curtains flowing in the breeze, and fields of flowers and, you know, velvet.

How did you come to use high school metaphors to touch on politics with “Miss Americana & the Heartbreak Prince”?

There are so many influences that go into that particular song. I wrote it a couple of months after midterm elections, and I wanted to take the idea of politics and pick a metaphorical place for that to exist. And so I was thinking about a traditional American high school, where there’s all these kinds of social events that could make someone feel completely alienated. And I think a lot of people in our political landscape are just feeling like we need to huddle up under the bleachers and figure out a plan to make things better.

I feel like your Fall Out Boy fandom might’ve slipped out in that title.

I love Fall Out Boy so much. Their songwriting really influenced me, lyrically, maybe more than anyone else. They take a phrase and they twist it. “Loaded God complex/Cock it and pull it”? When I heard that, I was like, “I’m dreaming.”

You sing about “American stories burning before me.” Do you mean the illusions of what America is?

It’s about the illusions of what I thought America was before our political landscape took this turn, and that naivete that we used to have about it. And it’s also the idea of people who live in America, who just want to live their lives, make a living, have a family, love who they love, and watching those people lose their rights, or watching those people feel not at home in their home. I have that line “I see the high-fives between the bad guys” because not only are some really racist, horrific undertones now becoming overtones in our political climate, but the people who are representing those concepts and that way of looking at the world are celebrating loudly, and it’s horrific.

You’re in this weird place of being a blond, blue-eyed pop star in this era — to the point where until you endorsed some Democratic candidates, right-wingers, and worse, assumed you were on their side.

I don’t think they do anymore. Yeah, that was jarring, and I didn’t hear about that until after it had happened. Because at this point, I, for a very long time, I didn’t have the internet on my phone, and my team and my family were really worried about me because I was not in a good place. And there was a lot of stuff that they just dealt with without telling me about it. Which is the only time that’s ever happened in my career. I’m always in the pilot seat, trying to fly the plane that is my career in exactly the direction I want to take it. But there was a time when I just had to throw my hands up and say, “Guys, I can’t. I can’t do this. I need you to just take over for me and I’m just going to disappear.”

Are you referring to when a white-supremacist site suggested you were on their team?

I didn’t even see that, but, like, if that happened, that’s just disgusting. There’s literally nothing worse than white supremacy. It’s repulsive. There should be no place for it. Really, I keep trying to learn as much as I can about politics, and it’s become something I’m now obsessed with, whereas before, I was living in this sort of political ambivalence, because the person I voted for had always won. We were in such an amazing time when Obama was president because foreign nations respected us. We were so excited to have this dignified person in the White House. My first election was voting for him when he made it into office, and then voting to re-elect him. I think a lot of people are like me, where they just didn’t really know that this could happen. But I’m just focused on the 2020 election. I’m really focused on it. I’m really focused on how I can help and not hinder. Because I also don’t want it to backfire again, because I do feel that the celebrity involvement with Hillary’s campaign was used against her in a lot of ways.

You took a lot of heat for not getting involved. Does any part of you regret that you just didn’t say “fuck it” and gotten more specific when you said to vote that November?

Totally. Yeah, I regret a lot of things all the time. It’s like a daily ritual.

Were you just convinced that it would backfire?

That’s literally what it was. Yeah. It’s a very powerful thing when you legitimately feel like numbers have proven that pretty much everyone hates you. Like, quantifiably. That’s not me being dramatic. And you know that.

There were a lot of people in those stadiums.

It’s true. But that was two years later. . . . I do think, as a party, we need to be more of a team. With Republicans, if you’re wearing that red hat, you’re one of them. And if we’re going to do anything to change what’s happening, we need to stick together. We need to stop dissecting why someone’s on our side or if they’re on our side in the right way or if they phrased it correctly. We need to not have the right kind of Democrat and the wrong kind of Democrat. We need to just be like, “You’re a Democrat? Sick. Get in the car. We’re going to the mall.”

Here’s a hard question for you: As a superfan, what did you think of the Game of Thrones finale?

Oh, my God. I’ve spent a lot of time thinking about this. So, clinically our brain responds to our favorite show ending the same way we feel when a breakup occurs. I read that. There’s no good way for it to end. No matter what would have happened in that finale, people still would have been really upset because of the fact that it’s over.

I was glad to see you confirm that your line about a “list of names” was a reference to Arya.

I like to be influenced by movies and shows and books and stuff. I love to write about a character dynamic. And not all of my life is going to be as kind of complex as these intricate webs of characters on TV shows and movies.

There was a time when it was.

That’s amazing.

But is the idea that as your own life becomes less dramatic, you’ll need to pull ideas from other places?

I don’t feel like that yet. I think I might feel like that possibly when I have a family. If I have a family. [Pauses] I don’t know why I said that!
 But that’s what I’ve heard from other artists, that they were very protective of their personal life, so they had to draw inspiration from other things. But again, I don’t know why I said that. Because I don’t know how my life is going to go or what I’m going to do. But right now, I feel like it’s easier for me to write than it ever was.

You don’t talk about your relationship, but you’ll sing about it in wildly revealing detail. What’s the difference for you?

Singing about something helps you to express it in a way that feels more accurate. You cannot, no matter what, put words in a quote and have it move someone the same way as if you heard those words with the perfect sonic representation of that feeling. . . . There is that weird conflict in being a confessional songwriter and then also having my life, you know, 10 years ago, be catapulted into this strange pop-culture thing.

I’ve heard you say that people got too interested in which song was about who, which I can understand — at the same time, to be fair, it was a game you played into, wasn’t it?

I realized very early on that no matter what, that was going to happen to me regardless. So when you realize the rules of the game you’re playing and how it will affect you, you got to look at the board and make your strategy. But at the same time, writing songs has never been a strategic element of my career.
 But I’m not scared anymore to say that other things in my career, like how to market an album, are strictly strategic. And I’m sick of women not being able to say that they have strategic business minds — because male artists are allowed to. And so I’m sick and tired of having to pretend like I don’t mastermind my own business.
 But, it’s a different part of my brain than I use to write.

You’ve been masterminding your business since you were a teenager.

Yeah, but I’ve also tried very hard — and this is one thing I regret — to convince people that I wasn’t the one holding the puppet strings of my marketing existence, or the fact that I sit in a conference room several times a week and come up with these ideas. I felt for a very long time that people don’t want to think of a woman in music who isn’t just a happy, talented accident. We’re all forced to kind of be like, “Aw, shucks, this happened again! We’re still doing well! Aw, that’s so great.” Alex Morgan celebrating scoring a goal at the World Cup and getting shit for it is a perfect example of why we’re not allowed to flaunt or celebrate, or reveal that, like, “Oh, yeah, it was me. I came up with this stuff.” I think it’s really unfair. People love new female artists so much because they’re able to explain that woman’s success. There’s an easy trajectory. Look at the Game of Thrones finale. I specifically really related to Daenerys’ storyline because for me it portrayed that it is a lot easier for a woman to attain power than to maintain it.

I mean, she did murder . . .

It’s a total metaphor! Like, obviously I didn’t want Daenerys to become that kind of character, but in taking away what I chose to take away from it, I thought maybe they’re trying to portray her climbing the ladder to the top was a lot easier than maintaining it, because for me, the times when I felt like I was going insane was when I was trying to maintain my career in the same way that I ascended. It’s easier to get power than to keep it. It’s easier to get acclaim than to keep it. It’s easier to get attention than to keep it.

Well, I guess we should be glad you didn’t have a dragon in 2016. . . .

[Fiercely] I told you I don’t like that she did that! But, I mean, watching the show, though, maybe this is a reflection on how we treat women in power, how we are totally going to conspire against them and tear at them until they feel this — this insane shift, where you wonder, like, “What changed?” And I’ve had that happen, like, 60 times in my career where I’m like, “OK, you liked me last year, what changed? I guess I’ll change so I can keep entertaining you guys.”


You once said that your mom could never punish you when you were little because you’d punish yourself. This idea of changing in the face of criticism and needing approval — that’s all part of wanting to be good, right? Whatever that means. But that seems to be a real driving force in your life.

Yeah, that’s definitely very perceptive of you. And the question posed to me is, if you kept trying to do good things, but everyone saw those things in a cynical way and assumed them to be done with bad motivation and bad intent, would you still do good things, even though nothing that you did was looked at as good? And the answer is, yes. Criticism that’s constructive is helpful to my character growth. Baseless criticism is stuff I’ve got to toss out now.

That sounds healthy. Is this therapy talking or is this just experience?

No, I’ve never been to therapy. I talk to my mom a lot, because my mom is the one who’s seen everything. God, it takes so long to download somebody on the last 29 years of my life, and my mom has seen it all. She knows exactly where I’m coming from. And we talk endlessly. There were times when I used to have really, really, really bad days where we would just be on the phone for hours and hours and hours. I’d write something that I wanted to say, and instead of posting it, I’d just read it to her.

I somehow connect all this to the lyric in “Daylight,” the idea of “so many lines that I’ve crossed unforgiven” — it’s a different kind of confession.

I am really glad you liked that line, because that’s something that does bother me, looking back at life and realizing that no matter what, you screw things up. Sometimes there are people that were in your life and they’re not anymore — and there’s nothing you can do about it. You can’t fix it, you can’t change it.
 I told the fans last night that sometimes on my bad days, I feel like my life is a pile of crap accumulated of only the bad headlines or the bad things that have happened, or the mistakes I’ve made or clichés or rumors or things that people think about me or have thought for the last 15 years. And that was part of the “Look What You Made Me Do” music video, where I had a pile of literal old selves fighting each other.


But, yeah, that line is indicative of my anxiety about how in life you can’t get everything right. A lot of times you make the wrong call, make the wrong decision. Say the wrong thing. Hurt people, even if you didn’t mean to.
 You don’t really know how to fix all of that. When it’s, like, 29 years’ worth.

To be Mr. “Rolling Stone” for a second, there’s a Springsteen lyric, “Ain’t no one leaving this world, buddy/Without their shirttail dirty or hands a little bloody.”

That’s really good! No one gets through it unscathed. No one gets through in one piece. I think that’s a hard thing for a lot of people to grasp. I know it was hard for me, because I kind of grew up thinking, “If I’m nice, and if I try to do the right thing, you know, maybe I can just, like, ace this whole thing.” And it turns out I can’t.

It’s interesting to look at “I Did Something Bad” in this context.

You pointing that out is really interesting because it’s something I’ve had to reconcile within myself in the last couple of years — that sort of “good” complex. Because from the time I was a kid I’d try to be kind, be a good person. Try really hard. But you get walked all over sometimes. And how do you respond to being walked all over? You can’t just sit there and eat your salad and let it happen. “I Did Something Bad” was about doing something that was so against what I would usually do.
 Katy [Perry] and I were talking about our signs. . . . [Laughs] Of course we were.

That’s the greatest sentence ever.

[Laughs] I hate you. We were talking about our signs because we had this really, really long talk when we were reconnecting and stuff. And I remember in the long talk, she was like, “If we had one glass of white wine right now, we’d both be crying.” Because we were drinking tea. We’ve had some really good conversations.

We were talking about how we’ve had miscommunications with people in the past, not even specifically with each other. She’s like, “I’m a Scorpio. Scorpios just strike when they feel threatened.” And I was like, “Well, I’m an archer. We literally stand back, assess the situation, process how we feel about it, raise a bow, pull it back, and fire.”
 So it’s completely different ways of processing pain, confusion, misconception. And oftentimes I’ve had this delay in feeling something that hurts me and then saying that it hurts me. Do you know what I mean? And so I can understand how people in my life would have been like, “Whoa, I didn’t know that was how you felt.” Because it takes me a second.

If you watch the video of the 2009 VMAs, I literally freeze. I literally stand there. And that is how I handle any discomfort, any pain. I stand there, I freeze. And then five minutes later, I know how I feel. But in the moment, I’m probably overreacting and I should be nice. Then I process it, and in five minutes, if it’s gone, it’s past, and I’m like, “I was overreacting, everything’s fine. I can get through this. I’m glad I didn’t say anything harsh in the moment.” But when it’s actually something bad that happened, and I feel really, really hurt or upset about it, I only know after the fact. Because I’ve tried so hard to squash it: “This probably isn’t what you think.” That’s something I had to work on.

You could end up gaslighting yourself.

Yeah, for sure. ’Cause so many situations where if I would have said the first thing that came to my mind, people would have been like, “Whoa!” And maybe I would have been wrong or combative. So a couple of years ago I started working on actually just responding to my emotions in a quicker fashion. And it’s really helped with stuff. It’s helped so much because sometimes you get in arguments. But conflict in the moment is so much better than combat after the fact.

Well, thanks.

I do feel like I just did a therapy session. As someone who’s never been to therapy, I can safely say that was the best therapy session."

my tears ricochet Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I’m on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
’Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Interlude]
I'm literally— I don't know this, I'm sorry

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, nеver knowing what they'll mean
Somе to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn’t want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


[Chorus]
I didn’t have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I’d fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you, when I'm screaming at the sky
And when you can't sleep at night, you hear my st—

[Breakdown]
She does that crazy, like, screaming thing that’s way cool
That I could never do, and then she's, like—

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


[Outro]
That's fun!
Ok, cool"

Tim McGraw (Commentary) Lyrics
Taylor Swift: Hey, I'm Taylor Swift and you're listening to Big Machine Radio

Becca: And I'm Becca, and we're celebrating the anniversaries of the release of Taylor Swift's albums, because, you know, she always tends to release her albums on October or November. That means there are a lot of milestones to celebrate around this time of year. In fact, it was twelve years ago that wе were first introduced to Taylor through hеr self-titled debut album. You know, when you think about it, it's hard to believe that's already been twelve years and, in sme ways, it's hard to believe it's only been twelve years. But it happened October 24th, 2006, that's when the world was introduced to Taylor Swift and all of her incredible songs, like ""Tim McGraw,"" ""Teardrops On My Guitar,"" ""Picture to Burn,"" and all of those songs that laid the foundation for what has become an incredible carreer for Taylor Swift. And during this special, we're going to revisit every single one of those songs off of Taylor Swift's debut album. We're also gonna be hearing from Taylor, we have dugged back into our archives and found Taylor talking about this album and where she was at in her life back at that time. Not surprising, she says Tim McGraw is a song that she wrote based on one of her true personal life stories, in fact, she didn't actually think that it would be a significant in her carrer as it was

Taylor Swift: I wrote it about this guy that I was dating that was about to go off for college and I knew we were gonna break up, so I started thinking about all the things I knew that reminded him of me. And, um, you know, one of the first things that came to mind was Tim McGraw. And this song, really, I didn't think anything of it when I wrote it. Certainly didn't think it would be a single, certainly didn't think it would be a hit single. And, you know, when I played it to my record label, they were just, like, ""Well, that's your first single.""

Becca: For a lot of people, this was their introdution to Taylor Swift. When this song came on the radio, it's ""Tim McGraw"" on Big Machine Radio"

Love Story (Pop Mix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

[Chorus]
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

Tim McGraw (Live from SoHo) Lyrics
[Spoken Intro]
This is the song that got it all started for me
It's called ""Tim McGraw""

[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me


[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is:
""Is when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""


[Chorus]
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Ooh, think of me
Mmmm

[Outro]
He said the way my blue eyes shine
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Thank you so much"

Christmas Tree Farm (Recorded Live at the 2019 iHeartRadio Jingle Ball) Lyrics
[Intro]
It's Jingle Ball, there’s Santa hats everywhere
You're never too far away from one
And you know, I was wondering if maybe you would want me to sing a Christmas song that I wrote?

[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin’ is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true


[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everythin’ is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin’ the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein’ in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we’re there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)


[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (Darling)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas (I just want you to know)
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
I love you"

[Verse 1]
I remember tears streaming down your face when I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said don’t leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Hook]
Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light, you and I’ll be safe and sound

[Verse 2]
Don't you dare look out your window, darling everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby even when the musics gone, gone

[Hook]
Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound"

Mary’s Song (Oh My My My) (Live from SoHo) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She said, I was seven and you were nine
I looked at you like the stars that shined
In the sky‚ the pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
Growing up and falling in love and our mamas smiled
And rolled their eyes and said oh my my my

[Chorus]
Take me back to the house in the backyard tree
Said you'd beat me up‚ you were bigger than me
You never did‚ you never did
Take me back when our world was one block wide
I dared you to kiss me and ran when you tried
Just two kids, you and I
Oh my my my my

[Verse 2]
Well, I was sixteen when suddenly
I wasn't that little girl you used to see
But your eyes still shined like pretty lights
And our daddies used to joke about the two of us
They never believed we'd really fall in love
And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said oh my my my


[Chorus]
Take me back to the creek beds we turned up
Two A.M. riding in your truck and all I need is you next to me
Take me back to the time we had our very first fight
The slamming of doors instead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside till the morning light
Oh my my my my

[Verse 3]
A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town
And you looked at me‚ got down on one knee

[Chorus]
Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said I do and I did too
Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch
After all this time, you and I

[Outro]
And I'll be eighty-seven; you'll be eighty-nine
I'll still look at you like the stars that shine
In the sky, oh my my my
Thank you so much!"

Hey Apple Music, welcome to my ""I Love You, It's Ruining My Life"" playlist
This is a list of songs about getting so caught up in the idea of something that you have a hard time seeing the red flags
Possibly resulting in moments of denial and maybe a little bit of delusion

I Can Do It With A Broken Heart (Dombresky Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I can read your mind
""She's having the time of her life""
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(One, two, three)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid, I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it,"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile, even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life, but that life was too short

Breakin' down, I hit the floor
All thе pieces of me shattеred as the crowd was chantin', ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin', I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart

[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art

You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart

[Verse 2]
I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
(One, two, three)


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid, I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it,"" and I did

Lights, camera, bitch, smile, in stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time, but that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin', I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him
But he avoids me (Avoids me) like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart"

Musicians on Musicians: Paul McCartney & Taylor Swift Lyrics
This is an annotated version of Rolling Stone’s December 2020 cover story, featuring Paul McCartney and Taylor Swift.
Taylor Swift arrived early to Paul McCartney’s London office in October, “mask on, brimming with excitement.” “I mostly work from home these days,” she writes about that day, “and today feels like a rare school field trip that you actually want to go on.”

Swift showed up without a team, doing her own hair and makeup. In addition to being two of the most famous pop songwriters in the world, Swift and McCartney have spent the past year on similar journeys. McCartney, isolated at home in the U.K., recorded McCartney III. Like his first solo album, in 1970, he played nearly all of the instruments himself, resulting in some of his most wildly ambitious songs in a long time. Swift also took some new chances, writing over email with the National’s Aaron Dessner and recording the raw folklore, which abandons arena pop entirely in favor of rich character songs. It’s the bestselling album of 2020.

Swift listened to McCartney III as she prepared for today’s conversation; McCartney delved into folkore. Before the photo shoot, Swift caught up with his daughters Mary (who would be photographing them) and Stella (who designed Swift’s clothes; the two are close friends).
 “I’ve met Paul a few times, mostly onstage at parties, but we’ll get to that later,” Swift writes. “Soon he walks in with his wife, Nancy. They’re a sunny and playful pair, and I immediately feel like this will be a good day. During the shoot, Paul dances and takes almost none of it too seriously and sings along to Motown songs playing from the speakers. A few times Mary scolds, ‘Daaad, try to stand still!’ And it feels like a window into a pretty awesome family dynamic. We walk into his office for a chat, and after I make a nervous request, Paul is kind enough to handwrite my favorite lyric of his and sign it. He makes a joke about me selling it, and I laugh because it’s something I know I’ll cherish for the rest of my life. That’s around the time when we start talking about music.”

Taylor Swift: I think it’s important to note that if this year had gone the way that we thought it was going to go, you and I would have played Glastonbury this year, and instead, you and I both made albums in isolation.


Paul McCartney: Yeah!

Swift: And I remember thinking it would have been so much fun because the times that I’ve run into you, I correlate with being some of the most fun nights of my life. I was at a party with you, when everybody just started playing music. And it was Dave Grohl playing, and you…


McCartney: You were playing one of his songs, weren’t you?

Swift: Yes, I was playing his song called “Best of You,” but I was playing it on piano, and he didn’t recognize it until about halfway through. I just remember thinking, “Are you the catalyst for the most fun times ever?” Is it your willingness to get up and play music that makes everyone feel like this is a thing that can happen tonight?

McCartney: I mean, I think it’s a bit of everything, isn’t it? I’ll tell you who was very … Reese Witherspoon was like, “Are you going to sing?” I said “Oh, I don’t know.” She said, “You’ve got to, yeah!” She’s bossing me around. So I said, “Whoa,” so it’s a bit of that.

Swift: I love that person, because the party does not turn musical without that person.

McCartney: Yeah, that’s true.

Swift: If nobody says, “Can you guys play music?” we’re not going to invite ourselves up onstage at whatever living-room party it is.

McCartney: I seem to remember Woody Harrelson got on the piano, and he starts playing “Let It Be,” and I’m thinking, “I can do that better.” So I said, “Come on, move over, Woody.” So we’re both playing it. It was really nice.… I love people like Dan Aykroyd, who’s just full of energy and he loves his music so much, but he’s not necessarily a musician, but he just wanders around the room, just saying, “You got to get up, got to get up, do some stuff.”


Swift: I listened to your new record. And I loved a lot of things about it, but it really did feel like kind of a flex to write, produce, and play every instrument on every track. To me, that’s like flexing a muscle and saying, “I can do all this on my own if I have to.”

McCartney: Well, I don’t think like that, I must admit. I just picked up some of these instruments over the years. We had a piano at home that my dad played, so I picked around on that. I wrote the melody to “When I’m 64” when I was, you know, a teenager.

Swift: Wow.

McCartney: When the Beatles went to Hamburg, there were always drum kits knocking around, so when there was a quiet moment, I’d say, “Do you mind if I have a knock around?” So I was able to practice, you know, without practicing. That’s why I play right-handed. Guitar was just the first instrument I got. Guitar turned to bass; it also turned into ukulele, mandolin. Suddenly, it’s like, “Wow,” but it’s really only two or three instruments.

Swift: Well, I think that’s downplaying it a little bit. In my mind, it came with a visual of you being in the country, kind of absorbing the sort of do-it-yourself [quality] that has had to come with the quarantine and this pandemic. I found that I’ve adapted a do-it-yourself mentality to a lot of things in my career that I used to outsource. I’m just wondering what a day of recording in the pandemic looked like for you.

McCartney: Well, I’m very lucky because I have a studio that’s, like, 20 minutes away from where I live. We were in lockdown on a farm, a sheep farm with my daughter Mary and her four kids and her husband. So I had four of my grandkids, I had Mary, who’s a great cook, so I would just drive myself to the studio. And there were two other guys that could come in and we’d be very careful and distanced and everything: my engineer Steve, and then my equipment guy Keith. So the three of us made the record, and I just started off. I had to do a little bit of film music — I had to do an instrumental for a film thing — so I did that. And I just kept going, and that turned into the opening track on the album. I would just come in, say, “Oh, yeah, what are we gonna do?” [Then] have some sort of idea, and start doing it. Normally, I’d start with the instrument I wrote it on, either piano or guitar, and then probably add some drums and then a bit of bass till it started to sound like a record, and then just gradually layer it all up. It was fun. What about yours? You’re playing guitar and piano on yours.

Swift: Yeah, on some of it, but a lot of it was made with Aaron Dessner, who’s in a band called the National that I really love.
 And I had met him at a concert a year before, and I had a conversation with him, asking him how he writes. It’s my favorite thing to ask people who I’m a fan of. And he had an interesting answer. He said, “All the band members live in different parts of the world. So I make tracks. And I send them to our lead singer, Matt, and he writes the top line.” I just remember thinking, “That is really efficient.” And I kind of stored it in my brain as a future idea for a project. You know, how you have these ideas… “Maybe one day I’ll do this.” I always had in my head: “Maybe one day I’ll work with Aaron Dessner.”

So when lockdown happened, I was in L.A., and we kind of got stuck there. It’s not a terrible place to be stuck. We were there for four months maybe, and during that time, I sent an email to Aaron Dessner and I said, “Do you think you would want to work during this time? Because my brain is all scrambled, and I need to make something, even if we’re just kind of making songs that we don’t know what will happen…”

McCartney: Yeah, that was the thing. You could do stuff — you didn’t really worry it was going to turn into anything.

Swift: Yeah, and it turned out he had been writing instrumental tracks to keep from absolutely going crazy during the pandemic as well, so he sends me this file of probably 30 instrumentals, and the first one I opened ended up being a song called “Cardigan,” and it really happened rapid-fire like that.
 He’d send me a track; he’d make new tracks, add to the folder; I would write the entire top line for a song, and he wouldn’t know what the song would be about, what it was going to be called, where I was going to put the chorus. I had originally thought, “Maybe I’ll make an album in the next year, and put it out in January or something,” but it ended up being done and we put it out in July. And I just thought there are no rules anymore, because I used to put all these parameters on myself, like, “How will this song sound in a stadium? How will this song sound on radio?” If you take away all the parameters, what do you make? And I guess the answer is folklore.

McCartney: And it’s more music for yourself than music that’s got to go do a job. My thing was similar to that: After having done this little bit of film music, I had a lot of stuff that I had been working on, but I’d said, “I’m just going home now,” and it’d be left half-finished. So I just started saying, “Well, what about that? I never finished that.” So we’d pull it out, and we said, “Oh, well, this could be good.” And because it didn’t have to amount to anything, I would say, “Ah, I really want to do tape loops. I don’t care if they fit on this song, I just want to do some.” So I go and make some tape loops, and put them in the song, just really trying to do stuff that I fancy.

I had no idea it would end up as an album; I may have been a bit less indulgent, but if a track was eight minutes long, to tell you the truth, what I thought was, “I’ll be taking it home tonight, Mary will be cooking, the grandkids will all be there running around, and someone, maybe Simon, Mary’s husband, is going to say, ‘What did you do today?’ And I’m going to go, ‘Oh,’ and then get my phone and play it for them.” So this became the ritual.

Swift: That’s the coziest thing I’ve ever heard.


McCartney: Well, it’s like eight minutes long, and I said, “I hate it when I’m playing someone something and it finishes after three minutes.” I kind of like that it just [continues] on.

Swift: You want to stay in the zone.

McCartney: It just keeps going on. I would just come home, “Well, what did you do today?” “Oh, well, I did this. I’m halfway through this,” or, “We finished this.”

Swift: I was wondering about the numerology element to McCartney III. McCartney I, II, and III have all come out on years with zeroes.

McCartney: Ends of decades.

Swift: Was that important?

McCartney: Yeah, well, this was being done in 2020, and I didn’t really think about it. I think everyone expected great things of 2020. “It’s gonna be great! Look at that number! 2020! Auspicious!” Then suddenly Covid hit, and it was like, “That’s gonna be auspicious all right, but maybe for the wrong reasons.” Someone said to me, “Well, you put out McCartney right after the Beatles broke up, and that was 1970, and then you did McCartney II in 1980.” And I said, “Oh, I’m going to release this in 2020 just for whatever you call it, the numerology.…”

Swift: The numerology, the kind of look, the symbolism. I love numbers. Numbers kind of rule my whole world. The numbers 13  … 89 is a big one. I have a few others that I find…

McCartney: Thirteen is lucky for some.

Swift: Yeah, it’s lucky for me. It’s my birthday. It’s all these weird coincidences of good things that have happened. Now, when I see it places, I look at it as a sign that things are going the way they’re supposed to.
 They may not be good now, they could be painful now, but things are on a track. I don’t know, I love the numerology.

McCartney: It’s spooky, Taylor. It’s very spooky. Now wait a minute: Where’d you get 89?

Swift: That’s when I was born, in 1989, and so I see it in different places and I just think it’s…

McCartney: No, it’s good. I like that, where certain things you attach yourself to, and you get a good feeling off them. I think that’s great.


Swift: Yeah, one of my favorite artists, Bon Iver, he has this thing with the number 22. But I was also wondering: You have always kind of seeked out a band or a communal atmosphere with like, you know, the Beatles and Wings, and then Egypt Station. I thought it was interesting when I realized you had made a record with no one else. I just wondered, did that feel natural?

McCartney: It’s one of the things I’ve done. Like with McCartney, because the Beatles had broken up, there was no alternative but to get a drum kit at home, get a guitar, get an amp, get a bass, and just make something for myself. So on that album, which I didn’t really expect to do very well, I don’t think it did. But people sort of say, “I like that. It was a very casual album.” It didn’t really have to mean anything. So I’ve done that, the play-everything-myself thing. And then I discovered synths and stuff, and sequencers, so I had a few of those at home. I just thought I’m going to play around with this and record it, so that became McCartney II. But it’s a thing I do. Certain people can do it. Stevie Wonder can do it. Stevie Winwood, I believe, has done it. So there are certain people quite like that.

When you’re working with someone else, you have to worry about their variances. Whereas your own variance, you kind of know it. It’s just something I’ve grown to like. Once you can do it, it becomes a little bit addictive. I actually made some records under the name the Fireman.

Swift: Love a pseudonym.

McCartney: Yeah, for the fun! But, you know, let’s face it, you crave fame and attention when you’re young. And I just remembered the other day, I was the guy in the Beatles that would write to journalists and say [speaks in a formal voice]: “We are a semiprofessional rock combo, and I’d think you’d like [us].… We’ve written over 100 songs (which was a lie), my friend John and I. If you mention us in your newspaper…” You know, I was always, like, craving the attention.

Swift: The hustle! That’s so great, though.

McCartney: Well, yeah, you need that.

Swift: Yeah, I think, when a pseudonym comes in is when you still have a love for making the work and you don’t want the work to become overshadowed by this thing that’s been built around you, based on what people know about you. And that’s when it’s really fun to create fake names and write under them.

McCartney: Do you ever do that?

Swift: Oh, yeah.

McCartney: Oh, yeah? Oh, well, we didn’t know that! Is that a widely known fact?

Swift: I think it is now, but it wasn’t. I wrote under the name Nils Sjöberg because those are two of the most popular names of Swedish males. I wrote this song called “This Is What You Came For” that Rihanna ended up singing. And nobody knew for a while.
 I remembered always hearing that when Prince wrote “Manic Monday,” they didn’t reveal it for a couple of months.

McCartney: Yeah, it also proves you can do something without the fame tag. I did something for Peter and Gordon; my girlfriend’s brother and his mate were in a band called Peter and Gordon. And I used to write under the name Bernard Webb.

Swift: [Laughs.] That’s a good one! I love it.

McCartney: As Americans call it, Ber-nard Webb. I did the Fireman thing. I worked with a producer, a guy called Youth, who’s this real cool dude. We got along great. He did a mix for me early on, and we got friendly. I would just go into the studio, and he would say, “Hey, what about this groove?” and he’d just made me have a little groove going. He’d say, “You ought to put some bass on it. Put some drums on it.” I’d just spend the whole day putting stuff on it. And we’d make these tracks, and nobody knew who Fireman was for a while. We must have sold all of 15 copies.

Swift: Thrilling, absolutely thrilling.

McCartney: And we didn’t mind, you know?

Swift: I think it’s so cool that you do projects that are just for you. Because I went with my family to see you in concert in 2010 or 2011, and the thing I took away from the show most was that it was the most selfless set list I had ever seen. It was completely geared toward what it would thrill us to hear.
 It had new stuff, but it had every hit we wanted to hear, every song we’d ever cried to, every song people had gotten married to, or been brokenhearted to. And I just remembered thinking, “I’ve got to remember that,” that you do that set list for your fans.

McCartney: You do that, do you?

Swift: I do now. I think that learning that lesson from you taught me at a really important stage in my career that if people want to hear “Love Story” and “Shake It Off,” and I’ve played them 300 million times, play them the 300-millionth-and-first time. I think there are times to be selfish in your career, and times to be selfless, and sometimes they line up.

McCartney: I always remembered going to concerts as a kid, completely before the Beatles, and I really hoped they would play the ones I loved. And if they didn’t, it was kind of disappointing. I had no money, and the family wasn’t wealthy. So this would be a big deal for me, to save up for months to afford the concert ticket.

Swift: Yeah, it feels like a bond. It feels like that person on the stage has given something, and it makes you as a crowd want to give even more back, in terms of applause, in terms of dedication. And I just remembered feeling that bond in the crowd, and thinking, “He’s up there playing these Beatles songs, my dad is crying, my mom is trying to figure out how to work her phone because her hands are shaking so much.” Because seeing the excitement course through not only me, but my family and the entire crowd in Nashville, it just was really special. I love learning lessons and not having to learn them the hard way. Like learning nice lessons I really value.

McCartney: Well, that’s great, and I’m glad that set you on that path. I understand people who don’t want to do that, and if you do, they’ll say, “Oh, it’s a jukebox show.” I hear what they’re saying. But I think it’s a bit of a cheat, because the people who come to our shows have spent a lot of money. We can afford to go to a couple of shows and it doesn’t make much difference. But a lot of ordinary working folks … it’s a big event in their life, and so I try and deliver. I also, like you say, try and put in a few weirdos.

Swift: That’s the best. I want to hear current things, too, to update me on where the artist is. I was wondering about lyrics, and where you were lyrically when you were making this record. Because when I was making folklore, I went lyrically in a total direction of escapism and romanticism.
 And I wrote songs imagining I was, like, a pioneer woman in a forbidden love affair [laughs].
 I was completely …

McCartney: Was this “I want to give you a child”? Is that one of the lines?

Swift: Oh, that’s a song called “Peace.”

McCartney: “Peace,” I like that one.

Swift: “Peace” is actually more rooted in my personal life. I know you have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life: carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you’ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living. I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalize things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can’t control if there’s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.

McCartney: So how does that go? Does your partner sympathize with that and understand?

Swift: Oh, absolutely.

McCartney: They have to, don’t they?

Swift: But I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids. Whether that’s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture — the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it’s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That’s what that song “Peace” is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave?
 Stella always tells me that she had as normal a childhood as she could ever hope for under the circumstances.

McCartney: Yeah, it was very important to us to try and keep their feet on the ground amongst the craziness.

Swift: She went to a regular school .…

McCartney: Yeah, she did.

Swift: And you would go trick-or-treating with them, wearing masks.

McCartney: All of them did, yeah. It was important, but it worked pretty well, because when they kind of reached adulthood, they would meet other kids who might have gone to private schools, who were a little less grounded.

And they could be the budding mothers to [kids]. I remember Mary had a friend, Orlando. Not Bloom. She used to really counsel him. And it’s ’cause she’d gone through that. Obviously, they got made fun of, my kids. They’d come in the classroom and somebody would sing, “Na na na na,” you know, one of the songs. And they’d have to handle that. They’d have to front it out.

Swift: Did that give you a lot of anxiety when you had kids, when you felt like all this pressure that’s been put on me is spilling over onto them, that they didn’t sign up for it? Was that hard for you?

McCartney: Yeah, a little bit, but it wasn’t like it is now. You know, we were just living a kind of semi-hippie life, where we withdrew from a lot of stuff. The kids would be doing all the ordinary things, and their school friends would be coming up to the house and having parties, and it was just great. I remember one lovely evening when it was Stella’s birthday, and she brought a bunch of school kids up. And, you know, they’d all ignore me. It happens very quickly. At first they’re like, “Oh, yeah, he’s like a famous guy,” and then it’s like [yawns]. I like that. I go in the other room and suddenly I hear this music going on. And one of the kids, his name was Luke, and he’s doing break dancing.

Swift: Ohhh!

McCartney: He was a really good break dancer, so all the kids are hanging out. That allowed them to be kind of normal with those kids. The other thing is, I don’t live fancy. I really don’t. Sometimes it’s a little bit of an embarrassment, if I’ve got someone coming to visit me, or who I know…

Swift: Cares about that stuff?

McCartney: Who’s got a nice big house, you know. Quincy Jones came to see me and I’m, like, making him a veggie burger or something. I’m doing some cooking. This was after I’d lost Linda, in between there. But the point I’m making is that I’m very consciously thinking, “Oh, God, Quincy’s got to be thinking, ‘What is this guy on? He hasn’t got big things going on. It’s not a fancy house at all. And we’re eating in the kitchen! He’s not even got the dining room going,’” you know?

Swift: I think that sounds like a perfect day.

McCartney: But that’s me. I’m awkward like that. That’s my kind of thing. Maybe I should have, like, a big stately home. Maybe I should get a staff. But I think I couldn’t do that. I’d be so embarrassed. I’d want to walk around dressed as I want to walk around, or naked, if I wanted to.

Swift: That can’t happen in Downton Abbey.

McCartney: [Laughs.] Exactly.

Swift: I remember what I wanted to know about, which is lyrics. Like, when you’re in this kind of strange, unparalleled time, and you’re making this record, are lyrics first? Or is it when you get a little melodic idea?

McCartney: It was a bit of both. As it kind of always is with me. There’s no fixed way. People used to ask me and John, “Well, who does the words, who does the music?” I used to say, “We both do both.” We used to say we don’t have a formula, and we don’t want one. Because the minute we get a formula, we should rip it up. I will sometimes, as I did with a couple of songs on this album, sit down at the piano and just start noodling around, and I’ll get a little idea and start to fill that out. So the lyrics — for me, it’s following a trail. I’ll start [sings “Find My Way,” a song from McCartney III]: “I can find my way. I know my left from right, da da da.” And I’ll just sort of fill it in. Like, we know this song, and I’m trying to remember the lyrics. Sometimes I’ll just be inspired by something. I had a little book which was all about the constellations and the stars and the orbits of Venus and.…

Swift: Oh, I know that song — “The Kiss of Venus”?

McCartney: Yeah, “The Kiss of Venus.” And I just thought, “That’s a nice phrase.” So I was actually just taking phrases out of the book, harmonic sounds. And the book is talking about the maths of the universe, and how when things orbit around each other, and if you trace all the patterns, it becomes like a lotus flower.

Swift: Wow.

McCartney: It’s very magical.

Swift: That is magical. I definitely relate to needing to find magical things in this very not-magical time, needing to read more books and learn to sew, and watch movies that take place hundreds of years ago. In a time where, if you look at the news, you just want to have a panic attack — I really relate to the idea that you are thinking about stars and constellations.

McCartney: Did you do that on folklore?

Swift: Yes. I was reading so much more than I ever did, and watching so many more films.

McCartney: What stuff were you reading?

Swift: I was reading, you know, books like Rebecca, by Daphne du Maurier, which I highly recommend, and books that dealt with times past, a world that doesn’t exist anymore. I was also using words I always wanted to use — kind of bigger, flowerier, prettier words, like “epiphany,” in songs.
 I always thought, “Well, that’ll never track on pop radio,” but when I was making this record, I thought, “What tracks? Nothing makes sense anymore. If there’s chaos everywhere, why don’t I just use the damn word I want to use in the song?”

McCartney: Exactly. So you’d see the word in a book and think, “I love that word”?

Swift: Yeah, I have favorite words, like “elegies” and “epiphany” and “divorcée,” and just words that I think sound beautiful, and I have lists and lists of them.


McCartney: How about “marzipan”?

Swift: Love ""marzipan.""

McCartney: The other day, I was remembering when we wrote “Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds”: “kaleidoscope.”

Swift: “Kaleidoscope” is one of mine! I have a song on 1989, a song called “Welcome to New York,” that I put the word “kaleidoscope” in just because I’m obsessed with the word.


McCartney: I think a love of words is a great thing, particularly if you’re going to try to write a lyric, and for me, it’s like, “What is this going to say to that person?” I often feel like I’m writing to someone who is not doing so well. So I’m trying to write songs that might help. Not in a goody-goody, crusading kind of way, but just thinking there have been so many times in my life when I’ve heard a song and felt so much better. I think that’s the angle I want, that inspirational thing.

I remember once, a friend of mine from Liverpool, we were teenagers and we were going to a fairground. He was a schoolmate, and we had these jackets that had a little fleck in the material, which was the cool thing at the time.

Swift: We should have done matching jackets for this photo shoot.

McCartney: Find me a fleck, I’m in. But we went to the fair, and I just remember — this is what happens with songs — there was this girl at the fair. This is just a little Liverpool fair — it was in a place called Sefton Park — and there was this girl, who was so beautiful. She wasn’t a star. She was so beautiful. Everyone was following her, and it’s like, “Wow.” It’s like a magical scene, you know? But all this gave me a headache, so I ended up going back to his house — I didn’t normally get headaches. And we thought, “What can we do?” So we put on the Elvis song “All Shook Up.” By the end of that song, my headache had gone. I thought, you know, “That’s powerful.”

Swift: That really is powerful.

McCartney: I love that, when people stop me in the street and say, “Oh, I was going through an illness and I listened to a lot of your stuff, and I’m better now and it got me through,” or kids will say, “It got me through exams.” You know, they’re studying, they’re going crazy, but they put your music on. I’m sure it happens with a lot of your fans. It inspires them, you know?

Swift: Yeah, I definitely think about that as a goal. There’s so much stress everywhere you turn that I kind of wanted to make an album that felt sort of like a hug, or like your favorite sweater that makes you feel like you want to put it on.

McCartney: What, a “cardigan”?

Swift: Like a good cardigan, a good, worn-in cardigan. Or something that makes you reminisce on your childhood.
 I think sadness can be cozy. It can obviously be traumatic and stressful, too, but I kind of was trying to lean into sadness that feels like somehow enveloping in not such a scary way — like nostalgia and whimsy incorporated into a feeling like you’re not all right. Because I don’t think anybody was really feeling like they were in their prime this year. Isolation can mean escaping into your imagination in a way that’s kind of nice.

McCartney: I think a lot of people have found that. I would say to people, “I feel a bit guilty about saying I’m actually enjoying this quarantine thing,” and people go, “Yeah, I know, don’t say it to anyone.” A lot of people are really suffering.

Swift: Because there’s a lot in life that’s arbitrary. Completely and totally arbitrary. And [the quarantine] is really shining a light on that, and also a lot of things we have that we outsource that you can actually do yourself.

McCartney: I love that. This is why I said I live simply. That’s, like, at the core of it. With so many things, something goes wrong and you go, “Oh, I’ll get somebody to fix that.” And then it’s like, “No, let me have a look at it.…”

Swift: Get a hammer and a nail.

McCartney: “Maybe I can put that picture up.” It’s not rocket science. The period after the Beatles, when we went to live in Scotland on a really — talk about dumpy — little farm. I mean, I see pictures of it now and I’m not ashamed, but I’m almost ashamed. Because it’s like, “God, nobody’s cleaned up around here.”

But it was really a relief. Because when I was with the Beatles, we’d formed Apple Records, and if I wanted a Christmas tree, someone would just buy it. And I thought, after a while, “No, you know what? I really would like to go and buy our Christmas tree. Because that’s what everyone does.” So you go down — “I’ll have that one” — and you carried it back. I mean, it’s little, but it’s huge at the same time.

I needed a table in Scotland and I was looking through a catalog and I thought, “I could make one. I did woodwork in school, so I know what a dovetail joint is.” So I just figured it out. I’m just sitting in the kitchen, and I’m whittling away at this wood and I made this little joint. There was no nail technology — it was glue. And I was scared to put it together. I said, “It’s not going to fit,” but one day, I got my woodwork glue and thought, “There’s no going back.” But it turned out to be a real nice little table I was very proud of. It was that sense of achievement.

The weird thing was, Stella went up to Scotland recently and I said, “Isn’t it there?” and she said, “No.” Anyway, I searched for it. Nobody remembered it. Somebody said, “Well, there’s a pile of wood in the corner of one of the barns, maybe that’s it. Maybe they used it for firewood.” I said, “No, it’s not firewood.” Anyway, we found it, and do you know how joyous that was for me? I was like, “You found my table?!” Somebody might say that’s a bit boring.

Swift: No, it’s cool!

McCartney: But it was a real sort of great thing for me to be able to do stuff for yourself. You were talking about sewing. I mean normally, in your position, you’ve got any amount of tailors.

Swift: Well, there’s been a bit of a baby boom recently; several of my friends have gotten pregnant.

McCartney: Oh, yeah, you’re at the age.

Swift: And I was just thinking, “I really want to spend time with my hands, making something for their children.” So I made this really cool flying-squirrel stuffed animal that I sent to one of my friends. I sent a teddy bear to another one, and I started making these little silk baby blankets with embroidery. It’s gotten pretty fancy.
 And I’ve been painting a lot.

McCartney: What do you paint? Watercolors?

Swift: Acrylic or oil. Whenever I do watercolor, all I paint is flowers.
 When I have oil, I really like to do landscapes. I always kind of return to painting a lonely little cottage on a hill.


McCartney: It’s a bit of a romantic dream. I agree with you, though, I think you’ve got to have dreams, particularly this year. You’ve got to have something to escape to. When you say “escapism,” it sounds like a dirty word, but this year, it definitely wasn’t. And in the books you’re reading, you’ve gone into that world. That’s, I think, a great thing. Then you come back out. I normally will read a lot before I go to bed. So I’ll come back out, then I’ll go to sleep, so I think it really is nice to have those dreams that can be fantasies or stuff you want to achieve.

Swift: You’re creating characters. This was the first album where I ever created characters, or wrote about the life of a real-life person. There’s a song called “the last great american dynasty” that’s about this real-life heiress who lived just an absolutely chaotic, hectic…


McCartney: She’s a fantasy character?

Swift: She’s a real person. Who lived in the house that I live in.


McCartney: She’s a real person? I listened to that and I thought, “Who is this?”

Swift: Her name was Rebekah Harkness. And she lived in the house that I ended up buying in Rhode Island. That’s how I learned about her.
 But she was a woman who was very, very talked about, and everything she did was scandalous. I found a connection in that. But I also was thinking about how you write “Eleanor Rigby” and go into that whole story about what all these people in this town are doing and how their lives intersect, and I hadn’t really done that in a very long time with my music. It had always been so microscope personal.

McCartney: Yeah, ’cause you were writing breakup songs like they were going out of style.

Swift: I was, before my luck changed [laughs]. I still write breakup songs. I love a good breakup song. Because somewhere in the world, I always have a friend going through a breakup, and that will make me write one.

McCartney: Yeah, this goes back to this thing of me and John: When you’ve got a formula, break it. I don’t have a formula. It’s the mood I’m in. So I love the idea of writing a character. And, you know, trying to think, “What am I basing this on?” So “Eleanor Rigby” was based on old ladies I knew as a kid. For some reason or other, I got great relationships with a couple of local old ladies. I was thinking the other day, I don’t know how I met them, it wasn’t like they were family. I’d just run into them, and I’d do their shopping for them.

Swift: That’s amazing.

McCartney: It just felt good to me. I would sit and talk, and they’d have amazing stories. That’s what I liked. They would have stories from the wartime — because I was born actually in the war — and so these old ladies, they were participating in the war. This one lady I used to sort of just hang out with, she had a crystal radio that I found very magical. In the war, a lot of people made their own radios — you’d make them out of crystals [sings The Twilight Zone theme].

Swift: How did I not know this? That sounds like something I would have tried to learn about.

McCartney: It’s interesting, because there is a lot of parallels with the virus and lockdowns and wartime. It happened to everyone. Like, this isn’t HIV, or SARS, or Avian flu, which happened to others, generally. This has happened to everyone, all around the world. That’s the defining thing about this particular virus. And, you know, my parents … it happened to everyone in Britain, including the queen and Churchill. War happened. So they were all part of this thing, and they all had to figure out a way through it. So you figured out folklore. I figured out McCartney III.

Swift: And a lot of people have been baking sourdough bread. Whatever gets you through!

McCartney: Some people used to make radios. And they’d take a crystal — we should look it up, but it actually is a crystal. I thought, “Oh, no, they just called it a crystal radio,” but it’s actually crystals like we know and love.

Swift: Wow.

McCartney: And somehow they get the radio waves — this crystal attracts them — they tune it in, and that’s how they used to get their news. Back to “Eleanor Rigby,” so I would think of her and think of what she’s doing and then just try to get lyrical, just try to bring poetry into it, words you love, just try to get images like “picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been,” and Father McKenzie “is darning his socks in the night.” You know, he’s a religious man, so I could’ve said, you know, “preparing his Bible,” which would have been more obvious. But “darning his socks” kind of says more about him. So you get into this lovely fantasy. And that’s the magic of songs, you know. It’s a black hole, and then you start doing this process, and then there’s this beautiful little flower that you’ve just made. So it is very like embroidery, making something.

Swift: Making a table.

McCartney: Making a table.

Swift: Wow, it would’ve been so fun to play Glastonbury for the 50th anniversary together.

McCartney: It would’ve been great, wouldn’t it? And I was going to be asking you to play with me.

Swift: Were you going to invite me? I was hoping that you would. I was going to ask you.

McCartney: I would’ve done “Shake It Off.”

Swift: Oh, my God, that would have been amazing.

McCartney: I know it, it’s in C!

Swift: One thing I just find so cool about you is that you really do seem to have the joy of it, still, just no matter what. You seem to have the purest sense of joy of playing an instrument and making music, and that’s just the best, I think.

McCartney: Well, we’re just so lucky, aren’t we?

Swift: We’re really lucky.

McCartney: I don’t know if it ever happens to you, but with me, it’s like, “Oh, my god, I’ve ended up as a musician.”

Swift: Yeah, I can’t believe it’s my job.

McCartney: I must tell you a story I told Mary the other day, which is just one of my favorite little sort of Beatles stories. We were in a terrible, big blizzard, going from London to Liverpool, which we always did. We’d be working in London and then drive back in the van, just the four of us with our roadie, who would be driving. And this was a blizzard. You couldn’t see the road. At one point, it slid off and it went down an embankment. So it was “Ahhh,” a bunch of yelling. We ended up at the bottom. It didn’t flip, luckily, but so there we are, and then it’s like, “Oh, how are we going to get back up? We’re in a van. It’s snowing, and there’s no way.” We’re all standing around in a little circle, and thinking, “What are we going to do?” And one of us said, “Well, something will happen.” And I thought that was just the greatest. I love that, that’s a philosophy.

Swift: “Something will happen.”

McCartney: And it did. We sort of went up the bank, we thumbed a lift, we got the lorry driver to take us, and Mal, our roadie, sorted the van and everything. So that was kind of our career. And I suppose that’s like how I ended up being a musician and a songwriter: “Something will happen.”

Swift: That’s the best.

McCartney: It’s so stupid it’s brilliant. It’s great if you’re ever in that sort of panic attack: “Oh, my God,” or, “Ahhh, what am I going to do?”

Swift: “Something will happen.”

McCartney: All right then, thanks for doing this, and this was, you know, a lot of fun.

Swift: You’re the best. This was so awesome. Those were some quality stories!"

A Place In This World (Commentary) Lyrics
Becca: Thanks for being here with Big Machine Radio and celebrating the twelfth year anniversary of Taylor Swift's debut album being released. We're going back and reliving some of the memories with Taylor about the album. In fact, Taylor talked about the fact that this debut album was written from her perspective as a young woman and writing about things that meant something to her

Taylor Swift: Well, you know, there's different songs about different things, and thеn I'll be the first one to stand up and say, ""Look, I'm sеventeen, never got married or had a kid and I'm not gonna write the songs about that, but I will write about what I have been through and what my friends have been through."" You know, I think, at a young age, I developed a really keen sense of observation and just being able to watch people and how they communicate with each other

Becca: And, you know, when I went back and read some of the commentary that fans have posted about Taylor Swift's debut album, it was obvious that, this next song, they were able to relate to on a very personal level. This is called ""A Place In This World,"" of Taylor Swift's debut album on Big Machine Radio"

Your Heart’s Somewhere Else Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I used to know everything you were thinking
But now I just know you're thinking 'bout someone else but me
I count the days, I count the words you say
I need to know you're alive and hoping I'll be by your side
Can't help but think that I'm driving you away
Don't let me think it's real, don't make me think you'll stay

[Chorus]
I don't know if you're with me
I know you're standing here
I always turn around just to know you're there
And I deny it
Here, I'm crying
It's hard to tell myself
Your heart's somewhere else

[Verse 2]
I see you now, I don't see happinеss
Don't want to hold you back but I still want you for myself
You look around, do you like the things you see?
You'rе in a cage but I can't stand to let you free
I can't help but know that I'm driving you away
Don't let me think your love won't someday go away

[Chorus]
I don't know if you're with me
I know you're standing here
Sometimes I turn around to see if you're still there
And I deny it
Here inside, I'm crying
It's hard to tell myself
Your heart's somewhere else


[Bridge]
I never thought your eyes would lose their happiness
I know the longer you stay, the more you love me less

[Chorus]
I don't know if you're with me
I know you're standing here
I always turn around just to know you're there
And I deny it
I am crying
It's hard to tell myself
Your heart's somewhere else
Your heart's somewhere else
Your heart's somewhere else"

gold rush (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Intro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking
Ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in

[Chorus]
But I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 1]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
I see me padding across your wooden floors
With my Eagles T-shirt hanging from the door

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I call you out on your contrarian wit
And the coastal town we wandered 'round had nеver seen a love as pure as it
And thеn it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it could never be


[Chorus]
'Cause I don't like a gold rush, gold rush
I don't like anticipatin' my face in a red flush
I don't like that anyone would die to feel your touch
Everybody wants you
Everybody wonders what it would be like to love you
Walk past, quick brush
I don't like slow motion, double vision in rose blush
I don't like that falling feels like flying 'til the bone crush
Everybody wants you
But I don't like a gold rush

[Verse 2]
What must it be like to grow up that beautiful?
With your hair falling into place like dominoes
My mind turns your life into folklore
I can't dare to dream about you anymore

[Refrain]
At dinner parties, I won't call you out on your contrarian wit
And the coastal town we never found will never see a love as pure as it
'Cause it fades into the gray of my day-old tea
'Cause it will never be

[Outro]
Gleaming, twinkling
Eyes like sinking
Ships on waters
So inviting, I almost jump in"

​​​​​​cruel summer Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn’t kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I’ve got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of thе vending machine
I'm not dying
We say that wе’ll just screw it up in these trying times
We’re not trying


[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I’m always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I’ve got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar, oh
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing that you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil


[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you"

Who’s Afraid Of Little Old Me? (Live At The Eras Tour) Lyrics
[Verse]
The ""Who's who?"" of ""Who’s that?""
Is poised for the attack
Well, my bare hands pathed their paths
You don't get to tell me about sad

[Pre-Chorus]
(Mm-mm-mm-mm)
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
(Mm-mm-mm-mm) Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Nothing makes me feel more alive

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who’s afraid of little old me?""

[Post-Chorus]
You should be
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)
(Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh)

[Bridge]
So, tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?
They say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you
Just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum whеre they raised mе
So all your kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears
Isn't that what they all say?
That I'll sue you, if you step on my la-awn
That I'm fearsome, and I'm wretched, and I’m wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
(Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh)
And that’s why you're still singin’ along


[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle
'Til the circus life made me mean
Don't you worry folks, we took out all her teeth
Who’s afraid of little old me?
Yeah, well, you should be

[Outro]
(You should be) You should be
(You should be) You should be
'Cause you tore me (You should be)
And you hurt me (You should be)
And you taught me (You should be)
You caged me, and you called me crazy
I am what I am 'cause, you trained me
So who's afraid of me?
So who's afraid of little old me?
(You should be)
Who's afraid of little old me?"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying this is it I've had enough
Because like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you

[Pre-Chorus]
You called it off again last night
But this time I'm telling you
I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Like ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for a screaming that I'm right
And you hide away
And find your piece of mind with some indie record
That's much cooler than mine


[Pre-Chorus]
You called me up again tonight
But this time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say never say never
So he calls me and he's like
'I still love you'
And I'm just like 'this is exhausting'
We are never getting back together
Like ever

[Chorus]
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together"

Anti-Hero (Kungs Remix Extended Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
(I'm the problem, I-I-I'm the problem, it's—)
(I'm the problem, it's—)

[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)

I wake up scrеaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're lеaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Breakdown]
(I'll stare, I'll stare, I'll stare dire—, I'll stare)
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'll stare, I'll stare, I'll stare dire—, I'll stare)
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
(I'll stare, I'll stare) It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
(I'm the problem, I-I-I'm the problem, it's—)
I'll stare directly in the sun but never in the mirror
(I'm the problem, I'm the problem, it's—)
(I'm the problem, I-I-I'm the problem, it's—)
(I'm the problem, I'm the problem, it's—)


[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Outro]
(I'll stare dire—, I'll stare, I'll stare dire—, I'll stare, I'll stare dire—, I'll stare)
(I'll stare dire—, I'll stare, I'll stare dire—, I'll stare, I'll stare dire—, I'll stare)
(I'll stare dire—)
Always rooting for the anti-hero"

Red Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong


[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Yeah red
Burning red
Burning red"

[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive night on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate


[Post-Chorus]
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate


[Post-Chorus]
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wonder, when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes, when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine all the time

[Chorus]
('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)
Is it chill that you're in my head? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)

(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)
Is it too soon to do this yet? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night
But ooh, ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Post-Chorus]
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight
But ooh, ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ever) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh, ooh-ooh (Oh-oh-oh)

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever"" (No)

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh, ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together


[Outro]
We (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh)
Getting back together
We (Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh; oh-oh)
Getting back together (Yeah)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"

A Message From Taylor (Am I Allowed to Cry? Songs) Lyrics
Hi Apple Music, you have found the ""Am I Allowed to Cry?"" playlist
This playlist takes you through the songs I've written when I was int bargaining stage
Times when, you know, you’re trying to make deals with yourself or someone that you care about
You're trying to make things better, you're often times feeling really desperate because often times we have a sort of gut intuition that tells us things are not gonna go the way that we hope
Which makes us more desperate, which makes us bargain more
Hope you enjoy the playlist"

Style Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
Heard from you
I should just tell you to leave
Cause I know exactly where it leads
But I watch us go round and round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road
Takes me home
Lights are off, he's taking off his coat
I say ""I've heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl
He says ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking about you, and I""
I said ""I've been there too a few times""


[Chorus]
Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
We never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Bridge]
Take me home
Just take me home
Just take me home

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back everytime
Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"

Why Do You Tell Me? Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I tried to impress you
It didn’t matter to you, I don’t matter to you
But you tried to make me think I was crazy
“Put all these dreams on hold,” that’s what I was being told

[Pre-Chorus]
Tugging at my heartstrings
Every little part sings, “Ooh, you’re gonna bring me down”
But I don’t need to know what you don’t need to show
Well I don’t wanna go down

[Chorus]
So why do you tell me you believe in heaven?
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it’s tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me?
You believe in me

[Verse 2]
It hurts so bad to hear you say it
Did I really go so wrong? Tell me now, what’s going on?
Hearts fall like a broken angel
Did you mean to break me down every time I turn around?

[Pre-Chorus]
Tugging at my heartstrings
Every little part sings, “Ooh, you’re gonna bring me down”
But I don’t need to know what you don’t need to show
Well I don’t wanna go down


[Chorus]
So why do you tell me you believe in heaven?
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it’s tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me?
You believe in me

[Outro]
Why do you tell me you believe in heaven?
Then you get me where it hurts just when I turned around
And I try to fight this hole inside, it’s tearing me to pieces
Why do you tell me you believe in me?
You believe in me"

Mine (Live/2011) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts


[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now


[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place

You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes


[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:


[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine oh-woah

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine
""Hold on, make it last""
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


[Outro]
Do you believe it?
We're gonna make it now
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now, see it now)"

I love you, family.

I love everyone who's inspired me to write a song, whether you know it or not. I love anyone who has ever turned the volume up when my song comes on the radio, anyone who has bought this album. Anyone who can sing along to my songs when I play them live. Anyone who's ever requested my song on the radio, or even remembered my name. If you ever see me in public, I want to meet you. I will thank you myself. You have let me into your life, and I will never be able to thank you enough for that. I love YOU, and I love God for putting you in my life.

Mastermind (Behind The Song) Lyrics
[Spoken]
""Mastermind"" is a song that I put last on the album because I'm really proud of it, and I love that, when we were making this song, we wanted the verse to sound like romance and this sort of heroes type of soundtrack, and then we wanted the chorus to sound like a villain has just entered the room and the idea that you're flipping this narrative, and you have been planning and plotting things and making them look like an accident — and I think that's sort of an inside joke between me and my fans, that I tend to do that. And so, this song is thе romantic version of that."

You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please tell me
'Cause one second it was perfеct
Now you're halfway out the door

[Chorus]
And I stare at thе phone, she still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always

[Verse 2]
1,2,3
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little girl?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew you for a minute, but I don't anymore


[Chorus]
And I stare at the phone, she still hasn't called
And you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby, I don't think so

[Bridge]
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Yeah, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?

[Chorus]
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
Oh, and I stare at the phone, she still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said forever and always
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said forever and always
You didn't mean it baby
You said forever and always, yeah"

Lover Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover


[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"

Ride On Lyrics
“Ride On” was featured on a 2003 demo CD, which was shared by Brian Mansfield via Instagram in November 2018. As of October 2019, no audio has surfaced online.
[Verse 1]
Think of an angel tonight
Think of something, my baby
'Cause everyone needs something to believe in
Somebody’s watching you tonight
You'll never know it now
But you're that one that they can’t live, live without

[Chorus]
As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on


[Verse 2]
And think of beginnings tonight
Believe in so much more than you can ever try to imagine
And look at the sunset tonight
Believe in something that's greater than your tiny world
Or broken heart

[Chorus]
As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on


[Bridge]
Some people waste it all looking for heaven
Maybe there's heaven, but what if
What if this is that heaven we're waiting for?
Buddy, you don't know
You'll never know

[Verse 3]
Baby, I'm watching you tonight
You never saw it before
But you're that one that I can’t live without
And I could go with you tonight
But love is a one-sided street
Don’t know and I'm not brave enough to find out

[Chorus]
As far as we know, we only live once
And this could be your masterpiece
And you never know what lies ahead
Life is made of falling down and getting back up again
The sun falls down every night and gets back up at dawn
Ride on"

False God (Live from Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love


[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
You can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard, you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah


[Outro]
We'd still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love
Still worship this love
(I love you guys, you sang that so loudly)
(That was so satisfying, I love you)"

Our Song (Live from SoHo) Lyrics
[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
Well, I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothing, I was just thinking
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said


[Chorus]
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Da da da da

[Bridge]
Well, I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: ""Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have""
And when I got home 'fore I said amen
Asking God if he could play it again
Play it again
Oh yeah
Oh oh yeah


[Outro]
I was riding shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
Thank you so much!"

Permanent Marker Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I know he loved you a long time ago
I ain't jealous of you, just thought you should know
You were never good enough for him or anything like me
So you might as well sit back 'cause I ain't trying to show maturity

[Chorus]
""X"" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?

[Verse 2]
I found that picture of you in that green dress
Sure had a good time cleaning up that mess
He found thirty other pieces but hе'll never find them all
Triеd to tape 'em back together, now he knows to keep it off the wall

[Chorus]
""X"" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker? Yeah, yeah
""X"" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Oh, just like the mark you knew you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart?
""X"" is the shape I drew through your face
In permanent marker, oh, yeah
Just like the mark that you knew that you were making
Who do you think you are
To write on his heart in permanent marker?

Ruin The Friendship (Original Songwriting Voice Memo) Lyrics
Would you mind singing in a room with Johan here as well?
Yeah
Just to see if it’s in the right tempo, or in the everyone-agreed tempo
Um, I have an amazing lyric that I think needs to be the, the, um
I have, um, a lyric that I think should be the title

And the line is
My advice is always ruin the friendship
Better that than regret it for all time
It’s called, the song, Ruin the Friendship
Nice

Yes. Yes
My advice is always ruin the friendship
Better that than regrеt it for all time

You know, like, like, yеah
So we’ll find some melody that’s like, yeah
Should have kissed you anyway
Should have done it
It wasn’t convenient, so I didn’t
Always ruin, always ruin the friendship

Always
You try, 85
Ten road and the lakeside beach
Watching the game from your brother’s cheek
You smile, yeah. 85
It was not an invitation


Should have kissed you anyway
Kissed you anyway
It was not convenient
But your girlfriend was away
Should have kissed you anyway
And then, um, shiny white floors

So the shiny wood floors underneath my feet
Disco ball makes everything look cheap
I love that line
Come on, everybody have fun
Wilted corsage dangles from my wrist
Over his shoulder, I caught a glimpse

Your smile is miles wide
So, the same way as it ends, your smile is miles wide
You like it?
Yeah, that’s cool

Yeah
My advice is always ruin the friendship
Wait, can’t we just, but we’re not coming back to the chorus after that

We could, we could, and it was not convenient
Should have kissed you anyway
We were, we were young and we could have just done it"

To Apple, Love Taylor Lyrics
Taylor posted this open letter to Apple on her Tumblr on June 21, 2015, as a response to Apple Music which allows users to have a 3-month trial without generating any profit for the artists or labels. This… Read More 
I write this to explain why I’ll be holding back my album, 1989, from the new streaming service, Apple Music. I feel this deserves an explanation because Apple has been and will continue to be one of my best partners in selling music and creating ways for me to connect with my fans. I respect the company and the truly ingenious minds that have created a legacy based on innovation and pushing the right boundaries.

I’m sure you are aware that Apple Music will be offering a free 3 month trial to anyone who signs up for the service. I’m not sure you know that Apple Music will not be paying writers, producers, or artists for those three months. I find it to be shocking, disappointing, and completely unlike this historically progressive and generous company.

This is not about me. Thankfully I am on my fifth album and can support myself, my band, crew, and entire management team by playing live shows. This is about the new artist or band that has just released their first single and will not be paid for its success. This is about the young songwriter who just got his or her first cut and thought that the royalties from that would get them out of debt. This is about the producer who works tirelessly to innovate and create, just like the innovators and creators at Apple are pioneering in their field…but will not get paid for a quarter of a year’s worth of plays on his or her songs.

These are not the complaints of a spoiled, petulant child. These are the echoed sentiments of every artist, writer and producer in my social circles who are afraid to speak up publicly because we admire and respect Apple so much. We simply do not respect this particular call.

I realize that Apple is working towards a goal of paid streaming. I think that is beautiful progress. We know how astronomically successful Apple has been and we know that this incredible company has the money to pay artists, writers and producers for the 3 month trial period… even if it is free for the fans trying it out.

Three months is a long time to go unpaid, and it is unfair to ask anyone to work for nothing. I say this with love, reverence, and admiration for everything else Apple has done. I hope that soon I can join them in the progression towards a streaming model that seems fair to those who create this music. I think this could be the platform that gets it right.

But I say to Apple with all due respect, it’s not too late to change this policy and change the minds of those in the music industry who will be deeply and gravely affected by this. We don’t ask you for free iPhones. Please don’t ask us to provide you with our music for no compensation.

‘I Was Angry.’ Taylor Swift on What Powered Her Sexual Assault Testimony Lyrics
Before the Harvey Weinstein allegations broke, and before #MeToo swept the Internet, Taylor Swift testified in court on Aug. 10 about being assaulted in a room full of people. Swift, who TIME recognized as one of the Silence Breakers who inspired women to speak out about harassment in this year’s Person of the Year issue, granted TIME her first interview since the trial.

In 2013, the singer-songwriter took a photo with a Colorado radio DJ after an interview. During that photo, Swift says, DJ David Mueller reached under her skirt and grabbed her rear end. Swift privately reported the incident to the station at which Mueller worked, and he was fired. Mueller then sued Swift for defamation; she countersued for a symbolic $1—and won.


Swift refused to be bullied on the stand. Her straightforward testimony was lauded by many for its fierceness. When asked why the pictures taken during the assault didn’t show the front of her skirt wrinkled as evidence of any wrongdoing, she said simply, “Because my ass is located at the back of my body.” When asked if she felt guilty about Mueller losing his job, she said, “I’m not going to let you or your client make me feel in any way that this is my fault. Here we are years later, and I’m being blamed for the unfortunate events of his life that are the product of his decisions—not mine.”

Like many of the women interviewed for the 2017 Person of the Year issue, Swift would not accept blame for the abuse she experienced. Her clear-eyed testimony marked one of several major milestones in the conversation around sexual harassment this year. Swift responded to questions about her experience from TIME in writing.

Why was it important for you to come forward about what happened to you?

In 2013, I met a DJ from a prominent country radio station in one of my pre-show meet and greets. When we were posing for the photo, he stuck his hand up my dress and grabbed onto my ass cheek. I squirmed and lurched sideways to get away from him, but he wouldn’t let go. At the time, I was headlining a major arena tour and there were a number of people in the room that saw this plus a photo of it happening. I figured that if he would be brazen enough to assault me under these risky circumstances and high stakes, imagine what he might do to a vulnerable, young artist if given the chance. It was important to report the incident to his radio station because I felt like they needed to know. The radio station conducted its own investigation and fired him. Two years later, he sued me.

How did you feel when you testified?

When I testified, I had already been in court all week and had to watch this man’s attorney bully, badger and harass my team including my mother over inane details and ridiculous minutiae, accusing them, and me, of lying. My mom was so upset after her cross-examination, she was physically too ill to come to court the day I was on the stand. I was angry. In that moment, I decided to forego any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened. This man hadn’t considered any formalities when he assaulted me, and his lawyer didn’t hold back on my mom—why should I be polite? I’m told it was the most amount of times the word “ass” has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.

How have people responded to your story?

People have been largely very supportive of my story since the trial began in August, but before that, I spent two years reading headlines referring to it as “The Taylor Swift Butt Grab Case” with internet trolls making a joke about what happened to me. The details were all skewed, as they often are. Most people thought I was suing him. There was an audible gasp in the courtroom when I was named as the defendant. Once it hit the news that I was in Denver dealing with this, there was an outpouring of support on social media and I have never appreciated it more. I spoke to Kesha on the phone and it really helped to talk to someone who had been through the demoralizing court process.


After this experience, what advice would you give to your fans?

I would tell people who find themselves in this situation that there is a great deal of blame placed on the victims in cases of sexual harassment and assault. You could be blamed for the fact that it happened, for reporting it and blamed for how you reacted. You might be made to feel like you’re overreacting, because society has made this stuff seem so casual. My advice is that you not blame yourself and do not accept the blame others will try to place on you. You should not be blamed for waiting 15 minutes or 15 days or 15 years to report sexual assault or harassment, or for the outcome of what happens to a person after he or she makes the choice to sexually harass or assault you.


Is this a watershed moment for the way we think about sexual assault and harassment in culture?


I think that this moment is important for awareness, for how parents are talking to their children, and how victims are processing their trauma, whether it be new or old. The brave women and men who have come forward this year have all moved the needle in terms of letting people know that this abuse of power shouldn’t be tolerated. Going to court to confront this type of behavior is a lonely and draining experience, even when you win, even when you have the financial ability to defend yourself. Even though awareness is higher than ever about workplace sexual harassment, there are still so many people who feel victimized, afraid and silenced by their abusers and circumstances. When the jury found in my favor, the man who sexually assaulted me was court-ordered to give me a symbolic $1. To this day he has not paid me that dollar, and I think that act of defiance is symbolic in itself."

You Belong With Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
She doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you (Alright, already we all float on)
Been here all along, so why can't you see? (No, don't you worry, we'll all float on, alright)
You belong with me (Already, we'll all float on, alright, don't worry, we'll all float on
)
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


[Outro]
You belong with me (I just wanna break you down so badly
)
Have you ever thought just maybe (Well I trip over every word you say
)
You belong with me (I just wanna break you down so badly
)
You belong with me (In the worst way
)"

Betty Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions about
Why you switched your homeroom
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
And I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
And the worst thing that I ever did
Is what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only 17, I don't know anything
But I know I...


[Verse 2]
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him

[Pre-Chorus]
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time, it was true
And the worst thing that I ever did
Is what I did to you

[Chorus]
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me?
Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only 17, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you


[Verse 3]
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up
Like a figment of my worst intentions
She said, ""James, get in, let's drive""
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long

Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinking in
And Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens
When you see my face again
And the only thing I want to do
Is make it up to you

[Bridge]
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Well, I showed up at your party
Will you have me?
Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the front porch
Front of all your stupid friends?


And when you kiss me
Will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only 17, I don't know anything
But I know I...

[Chorus 2]
Showed up to your party
Will you have me?
Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the front porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
And when you kiss me
Will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only 17, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you

[Outro]
Standing in my car again
Kissing in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
Yeah, you know I miss you"

Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

I don't start it, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

She needed cold, hard proof, so I gavе her some
She had thе envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Drivin' in your Benz
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge

[Chorus]
She don't start it, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately, she's been dressing for revenge


[Bridge]
Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough

[Verse 3]
While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante sh again

[Chorus]
I don't start it, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge"

We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus: Christina]
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22, 22

[Verse 2: Dani]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids, uh-uh, uh-uh
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping


[Pre-Chorus: Katherine]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus: Christina]
(Hey!)
I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22 (oh, oh, oh, oh, oh)
22
22, 22

[Bridge: Lisa]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you
Ooh, ooh, yeah


[Chorus: Christina]
(Hey!)
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling 22
Everything will be alright if (ooh) you keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22 (whoa, oh)
22 (dancing like)
22 (yeah, yeah), 22, (yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro: Lisa]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you"

Fortnight (Cults Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic (Aesthetic, yeah)

All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
(I wanna kill her)

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February

I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
(I wanna kill her)
And for a fortnight there, we were together

Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him
(I wanna kill him)


[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

[Outro: Post Malone, Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida
, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida
, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you"

Mary’s Song (Oh My My My) [Commentary] Lyrics
Becca: Twelve years ago, a young country hopeful named Taylor Swift released her debut album by the same name: Taylor Swift. And, since then, she has been making history, setting records, winning over millions of fans, and touching hundreds of thousands of people's lives with her music. And that's what we're doing today, celebrating Taylor Swift's twelfth anniversary since the release of her debut album. And, you know, she has so many different songs that coverеd a wide spectrum on her dеbut album, and Taylor said that was very intentional

Taylor: I think, for me, I just wanted to pick the songs that I thought represented me the best, and, you know, different emotions, and if I had one about being angry, I wasn't gonna put another one on that's about being angry, if I had one about missing somebody, I wasn't gonna put another one on about that. I tried to cover all bases, but not get repetitive so that nobody would be able to pigeonhole me and say, ""Oh, this album's all about this, or all about that."" I didn't want it to convey just one emotion

Becca: I know a lot of people love ""Mary's Song"" because it's such a fun and upbeat song. It's off of Taylor Swift's debut album, which is celebrating its twelfth year of release here on Big Machine Radio"

Anti-Hero Lyrics
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tirеd of my scheming
(For the last time)
It's mе, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from hell""
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees
It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Gorgeous Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
Oh, you should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a girlfriend, she's older than us
She's in the club doing I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Whiskey on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
Oh, you should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you
Oh, you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room, the darkened room
If you've got a boyfriend, I'm jealous of him
But if you're single that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad
Oh, you make me so happy it turns back to sad, yeah
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats
Alone, unless you wanna come along

[Chorus]
Oh, you're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face, oh
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You're gorgeous"

Oh-oh, it doesn't matter if he doesn't want you
Because everybody has that person

You deserve the love that you don't have, mm
He may not, oh, but someone does, yeah, mm
Someone loves you, somewhere out there
They're waiting, yeah"

Back To December Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you wеre mine
I'd go back to Decеmber, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall


[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time"

Me! Lyrics
I promise that you'll never find another like me

I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)


'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
I promise that you'll never find another like

Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you

There's something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it


[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

All that time
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of

[Chorus]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powеrs
Now I can see it all (I can see it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my gravе and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands (Your hands), your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (You've been) 'cause now ('Cause now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia


[Verse 1]
I heard you calling on the megaphone

You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me (Me), myself (Myself), and I (I)
Right before you lit my sky up

[Chorus]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (Sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine

Never Grow Up Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite night light
To you everything's funny, you got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you, won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up, never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At 14 there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's getting older too
And don't lose the way that you dance around in your pj's getting ready for school


[Chorus]
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you, nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to, just try to never grow up

[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is someday gonna be gone
So here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my night light on
Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up

[Chorus]
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
I could still be little
Oh I don't wanna grow up, wish I'd never grown up
It could still be simple
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart
And even though you want to, please try to never grow up
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Oh, never grow up, just never grow up"

Ours (Live/2011) Lyrics
Live version of Taylor’s song, Ours, on the Speak Now World Tour.
[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs

If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles

But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

[Breakdown]
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
So Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

[Outro]
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours"

False God Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
And they all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is your hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love


[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is your hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, mmm


[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Oh, mmm"

Anti-Hero (Mixed) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tirеd of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's mе, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees


[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Champagne Problems Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
'Cause I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating, no

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems


[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
Made a joke, ""It's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's sick in the head""
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems


[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems

Love Story (Live From Clear Channel Stripped 2008) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while


[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo save me I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring


[Chorus 3]
And said: ""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story baby just say 'yes'""

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

We Are Never Getting Back Together Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" because like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed your space. What?
Then you came around again and said
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change; trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up
You call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh we called it off again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never ever ever getting back together
And we are never ever ever getting back together
And you go talk to your friends
Who talk to my friends, who talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
No like, like ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me
Falling for it screaming that I'm right and you
Would hide away and find your piece of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you called me up again last night
But ooh, this time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never ever ever getting back together
And we are never ever ever getting back together
And you go talk to your friends
Who talk to my friends and then they'll talk to me
But we are never ever ever getting back together

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
So anyway listen- so she calls me up the other day, right
And she's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""Listen, you know what, this is exhausting
We are never getting back together, like ever""

[Chorus]
No oh, we are never ever ever getting back together
And we are never ever ever getting back together
And you go- listen- you go fucking talk to your friends and they're gonna talk to me
Because I'm not talking to you anymore okay? Good, yeah
Because we are never ever ever
We are never ever ever getting back together
And we are never ever ever getting back together
And you go talk to your friends
Who talk to my friends who talk to me
But we are never ever ever getting back together
Getting back together, together, together

Mad woman (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, ""I hate you forever""?


[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And thеre's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathе flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say, ""Move on,"" but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together


[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but
No one likes a mad woman

What a shame she went mad
You made her like that"

ME! Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there

[Pre-Chorus]
One of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

Baby, that's the fun of me

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
And there's a lot of lame guys out there
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
And there's a lot of lame guys out there


[Pre-Chorus]
One of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

But you know there is a ""me""
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
No, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
I promise that you'll never find another like

My Boy Only Breaks His Favourite Toys (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Oh, here we go again
The voices in his head
Called the rain to end our days of wild
The sickest army doll
Purchased at the mall
Rivulets descend my plastic smile

[Pre-Chorus]
But you should've seen him when he first got me

[Chorus]
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause it fit too right, puzzle pieces in the dead of night
I should've known it was a matter of time, oh, oh
My boy only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
There was a litany of reasons why
We could've playеd for keeps this time
I know I'm just repeating mysеlf
Put me back on my shelf
But first, pull the string
And I'll tell you that he runs
Because he loves me (He loves me)


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you should've seen him when he first saw me

[Chorus]
My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, toys, oh
I'm queen (I'm queen), of sand castles he destroys, oh, oh
'Cause I knew too much, there was danger in the heat of my touch
He saw forever, so he smashed it up, oh, oh
My boy (My boy), only breaks his favorite toys, oh, oh

[Bridge]
Once I fix me
He's gonna miss me
Once I fix me
He's gonna miss me

[Outro]
Just say when, I'd play again
He was my best friend down at the sandlot
I felt more when we played pretend
Than with all the Kens
'Cause he took me out of my box
Stole my tortured heart
Left all these broken parts
Told me I'm better off
But I'm not
I'm not, I'm not"

Baby, I'm sorry (I'm not sorry)
Payback is a bad chick
And baby, I'm the baddest
You messin' with a savage
Can't have this, can't have this
And it'd be nice of me to take it easy on ya, but no

[Verse 2: Katherine]
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more

[Verse 3: Lisa]
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only rеason you're holding me tonight
'Cause wе're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely

[Verse 4: Amy]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?


[Verse 5: Lauren]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 6: Katherine]
So you wanna play with magic?
Boy, you should know what you're fallin' for
Baby, do you dare to do this?
'Cause I'm coming at you like a dark horse

[Verse 7: Lisa]
Are you ready for, ready for
A perfect storm, perfect storm?
'Cause once you're mine, once you're mine
There's no going back

[Verse 8: Katherine]
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place


[Verse 9: Lauren]
You say I am loved when I can’t feel a thing
You say I am strong when I think I am weak
You say I am held when I am falling short
When I don’t belong, You say I am Yours

[Verse 10: Katherine & (Lauren)]
And I believe (I can see your halo)
Oh I believe (I can feel your halo)
What You say of me (I can see your halo)
I believe

[Verse 11: Amy]
I can see your halo
Everywhere I'm looking now
I'm surrounded by your embrace
Baby, I can see your halo
You know you're my saving grace

[Verse 12: Lisa]
I can feel your halo (halo) halo
I can see your halo (halo) halo
I can feel your halo (halo) halo

Down on an old winding road
And that's the story of how I learned
Not to believe everything that I'm told

Burn down the barn
And the photos we took
You think I'll forgive you
But you're not off the hook
You think I'll forgive you
But you're not off the hook

[Verse 2]
But despite all the warnings
And the lessons I learned
I trusted you
And then I got burned

[Chorus]
Burn down the barn
And the photos we took
You think I'll forgive you
But you're not off the hook
You think I'll forgive you
But you're not off the hook"

Delicate Lyrics
[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make any promises now, can we babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?


[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?


[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Yeah I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

August - Recorded At Electric Lady Studios Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
Never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you'rе back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in thе memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine


[Bridge]
Back when we were still changing for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
You were never mine
Do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all


Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all (For the hope of it all)"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying this is it, I've had enough cause like
We haven't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?

Then you come around again and say, baby
I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day, I say
I hate you we break up you call me I love you

Oooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
We called it off again last night
But oooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
This time I'm telling you I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever getting back together

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights and me
Falling for it screaming that I'm right and you
Would hide away and find your peace of mind with some
Indie record that's much cooler than mine

Oooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
You called me up again tonight
But oooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
This time I'm telling you I'm telling you


We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever getting back together

Oooo ooo ooo ooo ooo
Oooo ooo ooo ooo ooo

I used to think that we were forever ever
And I used to say never say never

So he calls me up and he's like
I still love you and I'm like
I mean I'm just like this is exhausting ok
We're never getting back together

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever getting back together

You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever getting back together"

Cruel Summer Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn’t kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I’ve got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying
We say that we’ll just screw it up in these trying times
We’re not trying
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I’m always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know


[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I’ve got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinning like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you


[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"""

Our Song (International Mix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said


[Chorus]
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da-da-da

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again


[Post-Chorus]
Play it again, oh yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Outro]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

Pretty Words Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Well I guess that you are supposed
To be all I'll ever need, apparently
The one who are to make sense of everything
According to the talk in this town that spins around in my mind
They try to sell me a feeling that I ain't buying

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody knows pretty words, they come and go
As easy a fool believes
So don't you go expecting me to fall because you whispered yours to me
I ain't your stupid girl
Chasin' pretty words

[Verse 2]
Now what makes you think that your gamble
Is gonna pay off on me?
Arе you that lucky?
After I watched you smile as thеy cry
You trade them so easily, for being free
So I'd best get wise to the game that you play
Or I'm only gonna have myself to blame

[Chorus]
Yeah, everybody knows pretty words, they come and go
As easy as a fool believes
So don't you go expecting me to fall because you whispered yours to me
And I ain't your stupid girl
Chasin' pretty words


[Bridge]
Try as you will to chip away at this stone
But in the end you'll find yourself alone

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody knows pretty words, they come and go
As easy as a fool believes
So don't you go expecting me to fall because you whispered yours to me
And everybody knows pretty words, they come and go
As easy as a fool believes
So don't you go expecting me to fall because you whispered yours to me
Cause I ain't your stupid girl
Chasin' pretty words"

Better Than Revenge Lyrics
[Intro]
Now go stand in the corner and think about what you did
Ha, time for a little revenge

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there, where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say sabotage

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha!


[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling
And she thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school, so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Think about what you did)

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
Whoa, whoa-ah-oh


[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa (she deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa
Soon she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, HA!

[Outro]
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (no, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (no)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are (so much better, yeah?)
See you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say sabotage"

cowboy like me (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, ""Dancin' is a dangerous game""
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

[Refrain]
I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

[Verse 2]
Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

[Refrain]
You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me


[Chorus]
Perched in the dark
Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

[Chorus]
You're a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Tellin' all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustlin' for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it


[Bridge]
And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to mess this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunchin' have their stories about
When you passed through town
Oh, but that was all before I locked it down

[Verse 3]
Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con

[Refrain]
I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

[Outro]
And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again"

“Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈” Lyrics
On October 7, 2018, Taylor Swift broke her notorious silence on US politics. She posted a lengthy caption on Instagram imploring fans and followers to get involved in the US Midterm Elections in November. … Read More 
I’m writing this post about the upcoming midterm elections on November 6th, in which I’ll be voting in the state of Tennessee. In the past I’ve been reluctant to publicly voice my political opinions, but due to several events in my life and in the world in the past two years, I feel very differently about that now. I always have and always will cast my vote based on which candidate will protect and fight for the human rights I believe we all deserve in this country. I believe in the fight for LGBTQ rights, and that any form of discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender is WRONG.
 I believe that the systemic racism we still see in this country towards people of color is terrifying, sickening and prevalent.

I cannot vote for someone who will not be willing to fight for dignity for ALL Americans, no matter their skin color, gender or who they love. Running for Senate in the state of Tennessee is a woman named Marsha Blackburn. As much as I have in the past and would like to continue voting for women in office, I cannot support Marsha Blackburn. Her voting record in Congress appalls and terrifies me. She voted against equal pay for women
. She voted against the Reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act, which attempts to protect women from domestic violence, stalking, and date rape. She believes businesses have a right to refuse service to gay couples. She also believes they should not have the right to marry. These are not MY Tennessee values
. I will be voting for Phil Bredesen for Senate and Jim Cooper for House of Representatives. Please, please educate yourself on the candidates running in your state and vote based on who most closely represents your values. For a lot of us, we may never find a candidate or party with whom we agree 100% on every issue, but we have to vote anyway.

So many intelligent, thoughtful, self-possessed people have turned 18 in the past two years and now have the right and privilege to make their vote count. But first you need to register, which is quick and easy to do. October 9th is the LAST DAY to register to vote in the state of TN. Go to vote.org and you can find all the info. Happy Voting! 🗳😃🌈"

You Belong With Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
But she doesn't get your humour like I do
And I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear t-shirts
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day that you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been hеre all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
You bеlong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on the park bench thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""
You got a smile that could light up this whole town
Haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day that you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby
You belong with me
You belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs and you tell me ;bout your dreams
I think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see
You belong with me (Oh)
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby
You belong with me
You belong with me


[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me"

Hold On (Live) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Jack Ingram]
I've been following your ghost
Running circles 'round this house
Tripping over memories
Trying to figure things out
It's been a few years and I miss you still
Got your picture on the window sill
Been thinking of ways, I got days to fill
I don't think I ever will

[Chorus: Jack Ingram & Taylor Swift]
Hold on to things you can't explain
Hold on to dancing in the rain
Hold on to kisses on the lips
Savor every sweet moment, cause baby this is it
And hold on
Hold on

[Verse 2: Jack Ingram, Both]
I've been cleaning up this mess
Found a metal box with some black and white photographs
A little faded but baby you sure do look good in that old dress, oh yes
Didn't we wish we were superstars?
Sign our names in the dust on your family car
We'd be waving to the crowd
You be the diva
And I'll play guitar


[Chorus: Jack Ingram & Taylor Swift]
Hold on to things you wanna be
Hold on to friends and family
Hold on to burning summer sun
It makes a difference, every one
Hold on
Hold on

[Verse 3: Jack Ingram & Taylor Swift]
Thinking that we'd say the same
But we didn't know that the world would change
Yeah it just keeps on spinning
And we just keep on holding on

[Chorus: Jack Ingram & Taylor Swift]
Hold on to things you can't explain
Hold on to dancing in the rain
Hold on to kisses on the lips
Savor every sweet moment, cause baby this is it
And hold on to things you wanna be
Hold on to friends and family
Hold on to burning summer sun
It makes a difference, every one
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on
Hold on"

Long Live (Taylor’s Version) (Terjemahan Indonesia) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Aku berkata, ""Ingatlah momen ini.""
Di pikiranku
Waktu ketika kita berdiri dengan tangan yang bergetar
Kerumunan yang bersorak-sorak dengan lantang
Kita adalah raja dan ratu
Dan mereka mengucapkan nama kita
Malam ketika kamu berdansa
Seakan kamu tahu bahwa hidup kita tak akan lagi sama
Kamu menegakkan kepalamu seperti superhero
Di halaman buku sejarah
Ini adalah akhir dari sebuah dekade
Tetapi awal dari sebuah era

[Chorus]
Panjang umur, tembok-tembok yang kita hancurkan
Bagaimana lampu-lampu kerjaan berkelip untuk kita semua
Aku berteriak, ""Panjang umur untuk semua keajaiban yang kita perbuat.""
Dan siap berkеlahi dengan orang yang berpura-pura
Suatu hari nanti, kita akan diingat

[Verse 2]
Aku berkata, ""Ingatlah pеrasaan ini.""
Aku mengoper foto-foto ke orang-orang
Foto-foto dahulu ketika kita berdiri di tepi jalan bertahun-tahun
Berangan-angan kejadian yang saat ini terjadi
Kita adalah raja dan ratu
Kamu menukar topi baseball-mu untuk sebuah mahkota
Ketika mereka menyerahkan piala
Dan kita mengangkatnya tinggi-tinggi pada penduduk kota
Orang-orang sinispun marah
Berteriak, ""Ini tidak mungkin!""
Karena untuk sesaat, grup band dengan celana jeans robek
Dapat menguasai dunia


[Chorus]
Panjang umur, tembok-tembok yang telah kita hancurkan
Bagaimana lampu-lampu kerjaan berkelip untuk kita semua
Aku berteriak, ""Panjang umur untuk semua keajaiban yang kita perbuat.""
Dan siap berkelahi dengan orang yang berpura-pura
Aku tidak takut
Panjang umur, gunung-gunung yang berhasil kita pindahkan
Ini adalah pengalaman terbaikku, melawan naga bersama kalian
Aku berteriak, ""Panjang umur raut wajah kalian""
Dan siap berkelahi dengan orang yang berpura-pura
Suatu hari nanti, kita akan diingat

[Bridge]
Peganganlah, mari kita berputar
Konfeti berjatuhan di tanah
Semoga memori indah ini menahan ketika kita jatuh
Akankah kalian menyisihkan waktu kalian? Berjanjilah padaku
Bahwa kalian akan selalu berada di sisiku
Akan tetapi, apabila Tuhan tidak berkehendak, takdir yang turun tangan
Dan memaksa kita masing-masing untuk mengucapkan selamat tinggal
Jika suatu hari nanti kalian memiliki anak
Ketika mereka menunjuk foto-foto kita
Tolong beritahu mereka namaku
Beritahu mereka, bagaimana kerumunan bersorak-sorak dengan lantang
Beritahu mereka bahwa aku berharap mereka bersinar
Panjang umur, tembok-tembok yang telah kita hancurkan
Ini adalah pengalaman terbaikku, bersama kalian


[Chorus]
Panjang umur, tembok-tembok yang telah kita hancurkan
Bagaimana lampu-lampu kerjaan berkelip untuk kita semua
Aku berteriak, ""Panjang umur untuk semua keajaiban yang kita perbuat.""
Dan siap berkelahi dengan orang yang berpura-pura
Aku tidak takut
Aku bernanyi, ""Panjang umur, gunung-gunung yang berhasil kita pindahkan.""
Ini adalah pengalaman terbaikku, melawan naga bersama kalian
Aku berteriak, ""Panjang umur raut wajah kalian""
Dan siap berkelahi dengan orang yang berpura-pura
Suatu hari nanti, kita akan diingat"

The Fate of Ophelia (The Chainsmokers Remix) Lyrics
[Intro: Taylor Swift]
(Ophelia)

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me (Me), myself (Myself), and I (I)
Right before you lit my sky up

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (Sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
The eldest daughter of a nobleman
Ophelia lived in fantasy
But love was a cold bed full of scorpions
The venom stole her sanity

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And if you'd never come for me (Come for me)
I might've lingered in purgatory
You wrap around me like a chain (A chain), a crown (A crown), a vine (A vine)
Pulling me into the fire

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
I remember when we broke up, the first time
Saying this is it I've had enough
Because like we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
Baby I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change
Trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say I hate you, we break up, you call me, I love you
You called it off again last night
But this time I'm telling you
I'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together
Like ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for a screaming that I'm right
And you hide away
And find your piece of mind with some indie record
That's much cooler than mine
You called me up again tonight
But this time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you


We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say never say never
So he calls me and he's like
'I still love you'
And I'm just like 'this is exhausting'
We are never getting back together
Like ever

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends talk to my friends talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together"

...Ready For It? Lyrics
[Verse 1: Dani, Lauren]
Knew he was a killer
First time that I saw him
Wonder how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom
Some, some boys are tryin' too hard
He don't try at all though
Younger than my exes but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus: Lisa]
I-I-I see how this is gonna go
Love me, and you'll never be alone
I-I know we won't never let this go
No one has to know

[Chorus: Katherine, Amy, Dani]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
All I ever see is you, baby, hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?
(Are you ready for it?)


[Verse 2: Dani, Christina]
Knew I was a robber
First time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief then
He can join the heist
And we'll move to an island and
And we can be like jailers
Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now
I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now

[Pre-Chorus: Lisa]
I-I-I see how this is gonna go
Love me and you'll never be alone
I-I know we won't never let this go
No one has to know

[Chorus: Katherine, Amy, Dani]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
All I ever see is you, baby, hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?
(Are you ready for it?)


[Post-Chorus: Christina]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
(Now I)
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Pre-Chorus: Lauren]
I-I-I see how this is gonna go
Love me me and you'll never be alone
I-I know we won't never let this go
No one has to know

[Chorus: Katherine, Amy]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
All I ever see is you (is you), baby (baby), hm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
In the middle of the night

[Post-Chorus: Christina]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
(Now I)
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
(Now I)


[Chorus: Amy]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you
So I take my time
Are you ready for it?

Lover Lyrics
[Verse 1: Chris & Bri]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
There's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

[Chorus: Chris, Bri & both]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever and I
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2: Bri & Chris]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place and we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus: Bri, Chris & both]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever and I
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover


[Bridge: Bri, Chris & both]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat (Seat, a seat)

[Chorus: Bri, Chris & both]
Can I go where you go? (I go where you go, baby)
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever and I
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, Bri, you're my, my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my

[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now I know

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around


[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

[Outro]
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now"

I knew you were trouble Lyrics
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care and i guess i liked that
And when i fell hard you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And i realize the blame is on me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down
Oh, i knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And i heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all i'll ever be
And now i see, now i see, now i see
He was long gone when he met me
And i realize the joke is on me
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble trouble trouble
And the saddest fear comes creepin' in
That you never loved me or her or anyone or anything, yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
'til you put me down
Oh, i knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places i'd never been
Now i'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

Shake It Off Lyrics
I stay up too late
Got nothing in my brain
That's what people say (hum, hum)
That's what people say (hum, hum)

I go on too many dates
But I can't make them stay
At least that's what people say (hum, hum)
That's what people say (hum, hum)

But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop moving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin' it's gonna be alright

Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I'll never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, that's what they don't see
(hum, hum)
I'm dancing on my own, I'll make the moves up as I go (hum
Hum)
And that's what they don't know, that's what they don't know


But I keep cruising
Can't stop, won't stop grooving
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin' it's gonna be alright

Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Hey, hey, hey
Just think while you been getting down and out about the
Liars
And the dirty dirty cheats of the world
You could have been getting down to this sick beat


My ex-man bought his new girlfriend
She's like ""Oh my God"", but I'm just gonna shake it
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby, we can shake, shake, shake

Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

Shake it off, shake it off
I, I shake it off, I shake it off

New Reputation: Taylor Swift shares intel on TS7, fan theories, and her next era Lyrics
THE PALM TREES ARRIVED IN FEBRUARY, seven in all, set against a pastel blue backdrop with superimposed stars. It appeared that a new Taylor Swift era was upon us — that the old happy-go-lucky Taylor was not, in fact, dead. Or did it? It was only an Instagram photo, just one more picture in an infinite content scroll. But it also came from a pop star known for prodigious hint-dropping, whose fans turn every piece of info into an online archaeological dig.


As expected, the summery post sent Swifties sifting through each detail with a fine-tooth comb. What did the trees symbolize? An overdue vacation? A recently purchased beach house? A secret palm-frond collection? Or maybe, as many surmised, it was new music.
 One Twitter user predicted that the number of stars in the background of the photo hinted at a single drop: “There’s about 60/61 [stars]️. There’s 61 days until April 26, FRIDAY, a SINGLE RELEASE day!” Another said it was the unofficial announcement of her next LP: “Okay so in this picture there are 4 palm trees on the left (4 country albums). There are two palm trees on the right (2 pop albums). There is one large palm tree in the middle. This represents her new album.” These may sound like ludicrous conspiracy theories — for the record, they were mostly correct — but they fit firmly within the Taylor Swift Musical Universe (it’s like the Marvel Cinematic Universe but with more guitars and fewer Stan Lee cameos).

“I posted that the day that I finished the seventh album,” says Swift about the photo.
 “I couldn’t expect [my fans] to know that. I figured they’d figure it out later, but a lot of their theories were actually correct. Those Easter eggs were just trying to establish that tone, which I foreshadowed ages ago in a Spotify vertical video for ‘Delicate’ by painting my nails those [pastel] colors.”


It’s now April, and the 29-year-old pop star is in a Los Angeles photo studio, giving her first sit-down magazine interview in three years. She wants to discuss the art of placing hints inside her work, as well as the upcoming record, which she recorded as soon as she finished the Reputation Tour. She’s also keen on detailing her own obsessions, talking up the TV shows, books, and songs that help shape her outlook on life.

Over the past 13 years, Swift has perfected the pop culture feedback loop: She shares updates about her life and drops hints about new music, which fans then gobble up and re-promote with their own theories, which Swift then re-shares on her Tumblr or incorporates into future clues. It’s like a T-Swift-built Escher staircase of personal memories and moments that tease what’s next. “I’ve trained them to be that way,” she says of her fans’ astute detective work. Swift is a pop culture fanatic herself (see: the jean jacket she’s wearing on the EW cover) and has an innate understanding of the lengths her audience will go to be a part of the original creation.
 “I love that they like the cryptic hint-dropping. Because as long as they like it, I’ll keep doing it. It’s fun. It feels mischievous and playful.”

Through this approach, Swift has designed the ultimate artistic scavenger hunt — and it’s easy to get swept up in its drama, even if you don’t listen to her music. Her moments aren’t always hidden, either. Sometimes Swift highlights aspects of her world just so fans feel like they’re on the journey with her. Like the time in March 2018 when pop singer Hayley Kiyoko was accused of shading Swift after mentioning her name during an interview. On Tumblr, Swift re-shared a fan’s post, adding commentary that defended Kiyoko, which immediately dispelled any conflicts between the two artists; Swift’s post subsequently received more than 29,000 notes.
 Four months later, she invited Kiyoko on stage during the Reputation Tour to sing her hit “Curious.” Kiyoko returned the favor when she had Swift join her that December at a benefit on behalf of the LGBTQ organization the Ally Coalition to perform “Delicate.” Fans of both artists were elated by the mutual support.

The feedback loop also extends outside of music. In October 2018, Swift broke her silence about politics by publicly endorsing two candidates for office in her adopted state of Tennessee, while encouraging her followers to register to vote. She kept up the civic momentum through Election Day when she asked fans to post selfies after voting; Swift then eagerly re-promoted her favorites on Instagram stories.

This practice of sharing and re-sharing and sharing again is why listeners consider Swift one of the world’s most accessible pop stars, someone willing to not only interact with her audience but invite them to secret listening sessions, or make the occasional surprise visit to their wedding or prom. It’s a symbiotic relationship, one that, as Swift tells EW, helped her dig out of the darker era of reputation. “It’s definitely the fans that made that tonal shift in the way I was feeling,” she says. “Songwriters need to communicate, and part of communicating correctly is when you put out a message that is understood the way you meant it. reputation was interesting because I’d never before had an album that wasn’t fully understood until it was seen live. When it first came out everyone thought it was just going to be angry; upon listening to the whole thing they realized it’s actually about love and friendship, and finding out what your priorities are.”

Then, during the Reputation Tour, she had an epiphany: that despite the caricature that she thought had been created of her, there were many people who saw what others had simply refused to. “I would look out into the audience and I’d see these amazing, thoughtful, caring, wonderful, empathetic people,” she says. “So often with our takedown culture, talking s— about a celebrity is basically the same as talking s— about the new iPhone. So when I go and I meet fans, I see that they actually see me as a flesh-and-blood human being. That — as contrived as it may sound — changed [me] completely, assigning humanity to my life.”

At tour’s end, she channeled that positive energy into the studio, recording the new album in just under three months. But the fast pace won’t mean a short LP. Swift confirmed that her seventh record (she hasn’t announced a title yet; the working nickname among fans is TS7) will include more songs than any of her previous releases.
 “I try not to go into making an album with any expectation,” she says. “I started to write so much that I knew immediately it would probably be bigger.”

The project will also feature a mix of old and new collaborators (on the candy-coated lead single “ME!” Swift brought in Panic! At the Disco frontman Brendon Urie and coproducer Joel Little, both of whom she had never worked with), but she is unsurprisingly coy about doling out much more information, as if doing so would break the carefully honed T-Swiftian feedback loop.
 “There’s a lot of a lot on this album,” she says. “I’m trying to convey an emotional spectrum. I definitely don’t wanna have too much of one thing…. You get some joyful songs and you get the bops, as they say.” There’s also, she adds, some “really, really, really, really sad songs,” but “not enough to where you need to worry about me.”

She gives us one more clue: The true distinction between TS7 and reputation is in the delivery. “This time around I feel more comfortable being brave enough to be vulnerable, because my fans are brave enough to be vulnerable with me. Once people delve into the album, it’ll become pretty clear that that’s more of the fingerprint of this — that it’s much more of a singer-songwriter, personal journey than the last one.”

The past month has seen a deluge of Swift activity, from the release of the new single to dropping more hints in interviews about the record and its title, which is apparently hidden somewhere inside the “ME!” music video (current fan guesses include Kaleidoscope and Daisy).
 But if the Easter eggs from the pop star seem like a business-as-usual routine, she says this album does indeed mark a new era of her life, where she’s been better able to prioritize what’s important to her.


“Our priorities can get messed up existing in a society that puts a currency on curating the way people see your life,” she says. “Social media has given people a way to express their art. I use it to connect with fans. But on the downside you feel like there are 3 trillion new invisible hoops that you have to jump through, and you feel like you’ll never be able to jump through them all correctly. I — along with a lot of my friends and fans — am trying to figure out how to navigate living my life and not just curating what I want people to think living my life is. I’m not always able to maintain a balance, and I think that’s important for everyone to know about. We’re always learning, and that’s something that I also had to learn — that I’ve got to be brave enough to learn. Learning in public is so humiliating sometimes…. Do I feel more balanced in my life than I ever have before? Um, probably yeah. But is that permanent? No. And I think being okay with that has put me in a bit of a better position.” Strong words to live by, to quote, to re-share, to tweet back to her, and see if she’ll respond."

The Crowd is Your King [Poem] Lyrics
Remember this city?
You've been here before in another life
On another tour

Remember her?
She's got a mortgage now
Straight teeth where there'd been metal brackets
Standing with her 8 year old daughter
You mouth ‘I know you’

In the millisecond gap in your choreography
To you, she will look exactly the same age as the first time you saw her
She will always be 14 and a half

Remember!
Lock right back into thе footwork
Any missed step is a misstep
You must rеmember everything
But mostly this:
The crowd is your king who has ruled over you for centuries
Benevolently
For the most part."

22 Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes (oh-oh, oh-oh)
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers (oh-oh, oh-oh)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time

[Chorus]
And I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything'll be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything'll be alright if we just keep dancing like we're
22, 22 (Yeah)

[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids (oh-oh, oh-oh)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreaming
Instead of sleeping


[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time

[Chorus]
And I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything'll be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me, but I bet you want to
Everything'll be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're 22
22 (And I don't know about you)
22, 22 (My god, yeah, ooh-ooh)

[Chorus]
And I don't know about you, but I'm feeling 22
Everything'll be alright if you keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me), but I bet you want to
Everything'll be alright (Alright) if we just keep dancing like we're
22, 22 (22)
22, 22 (Yeah)

[Outro]
(It feels like one of those nights)
We ditch the whole scene
(It feels like one of those nights)
We won't be sleeping
(It feels like one of those nights)
You look like bad news
And I gotta have you
And I gotta have you"

Don’t Blame Me Lyrics
[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shakin', pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, ""He's gone too far this time""

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life


[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus 2]
And baby, for you, I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me
My drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh-oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy (Oh-oh-oh)
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

I get so high, oh!
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me

New Romantics (Demo) Lyrics
Lyrics From Vinyl

[Verse 1]
We're all bored
We're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, and on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Life's just a classroom

[Chorus]
Baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
Every day is like a battle
But every night is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get swept off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free


[Verse 2]
We need love
What we really want is danger
We team up, then break up like a record changer
And the rumors, are terrible and cruel
But most of them are true

[Chorus]
Baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
Every day is like a battle
But every night is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get swept off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free

[Bridge]
So take my hand and we'll both stand inside a burning building
Maybe I'm a shit show, but I'm fun
And kinda cute and willing
And if I could be the anti-hero
You could be my perfect villain
We'll be the perfect storm
Leave me cold and keep me warm
Fall in love, then go to war
That's what new romance is for


[Chorus]
Baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
Every day is like a battle
But every night is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get swept off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free"

Fearless (Platinum Edition) [Liner Notes] Lyrics
Hello there!
First and foremost, thank you for buying the Fearless Platinum Edition. When I put out Fearless, I had high hopes and no expectations. A short time later, I sit here, trying to think of words that might fully express to you how thankful I am. On this new version of Fearless, you will find 6 new songs. They're songs about falling for someone who is so desperately out of reach, daydreaming about a superstar, jumping then falling into the most beautiful summer love imaginable, then trying not to go back in your mind to evеry laugh and everything you miss. Thesе are songs about how the stars twinkle a little brighter when you love someone, and how many fights could be resolved if they would just stand outside your window, throwing pebbles, screaming ""I'm in love with you!"" In my mind, these things are fearless. I'm crossing my fingers, hoping you will agree. :) I love you, forever and always.
Fearlessly, Taylor"

Person of the Year 2023: Taylor Swift Lyrics
Taylor Swift is telling me a story, and when Taylor Swift tells you a story, you listen, because you know it’s going to be good—not only because she’s had an extraordinary life, but because she’s an extraordinary storyteller. This one is about a time she got her heart broken, although not in the way you might expect.

She was 17, she says, and she had booked the biggest opportunity of her life so far—a highly coveted slot opening for country superstar Kenny Chesnеy on tour. “This was going to change my career,” she remеmbers. “I was so excited.” But a couple weeks later, Swift arrived home to find her mother Andrea sitting on the front steps of their house. “She was weeping,” Swift says. “Her head was in her hands as if there had been a family emergency.” Through sobs, Andrea told her daughter that Chesney’s tour had been sponsored by a beer company. Taylor was too young to join. “I was devastated,” Swift says.

But some months later, at Swift’s 18th birthday party, she saw Chesney’s promoter. He handed her a card from Chesney that read, as Swift recalls, “I’m sorry that you couldn’t come on the tour, so I wanted to make it up to you.” With the note was a check. “It was for more money than I’d ever seen in my life,” Swift says. “I was able to pay my band bonuses. I was able to pay for my tour buses. I was able to fuel my dreams.”

Listening to Swift share this, on a clear fall afternoon in her New York City apartment, I’m struck by how satisfying the story is. There are high stakes at the outset; there are details, vivid and sensory; there’s a twist that flips the action on its head; and there’s a happy ending for its hero. It takes her only about 30 seconds to recount this, but those 30 seconds contain an entire narrative world.

I’m not surprised. Swift has a preternatural skill for finding the story. Her anecdote about Chesney symbolizes a larger narrative in Swift’s life, one about redemption—where our protagonist discovers new happiness not despite challenges, but because of them. Swift, as we’ll discuss, took a few hits to get here. “I’ve been raised up and down the flagpole of public opinion so many times in the last 20 years,” she says as we tuck into a cozy den off the kitchen to talk, and she kicks off her shoes and curls up onto the sofa. “I’ve been given a tiara, then had it taken away.” She is seemingly unguarded in conversation, reflective about both where she’s been and where she finds herself now. After all, while she’s long been one of the biggest entertainers in the world, this year is different. “It feels like the breakthrough moment of my career, happening at 33,” she says. “And for the first time in my life, I was mentally tough enough to take what comes with that.” This is her story—even if she’s now so high that it’s hard to believe she was ever low.

Swift’s accomplishments as an artist—culturally, critically, and commercially—are so legion that to recount them seems almost beside the point. As a pop star, she sits in rarefied company, alongside Elvis Presley, Michael Jackson, and Madonna; as a songwriter, she has been compared to Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney, and Joni Mitchell. As a businesswoman, she has built an empire worth, by some estimates, over $1 billion. And as a celebrity—who by dint of being a woman is scrutinized for everything from whom she dates
 to what she wears—she has long commanded constant attention and knows how to use it. (“I don’t give Taylor advice about being famous,” Stevie Nicks tells me. “She doesn’t need it.”) But this year, something shifted. To discuss her movements felt like discussing politics or the weather—a language spoken so widely it needed no context. She became the main character of the world.

If you’re skeptical, consider it: How many conversations did you have about Taylor Swift this year? How many times did you see a photo of her while scrolling on your phone? Were you one of the people who made a pilgrimage to a city where she played? Did you buy a ticket to her concert film? Did you double-tap an Instagram post, or laugh at a tweet, or click on a headline about her? Did you find yourself humming “Cruel Summer” while waiting in line at the grocery store? Did a friend confess that they watched clips of the Eras Tour night after night on TikTok? Or did you?

Her epic career-retrospective tour recounting her artistic “eras,” which played 66 dates across the Americas this year, is projected to become the biggest of all time and the first to gross over a billion dollars; analysts talked about the “Taylor effect,” as politicians from Thailand, Hungary, and Chile implored her to play their countries. Cities, stadiums, and streets were renamed for her. Every time she came to a new place, a mini economic boom took place as hotels and restaurants saw a surge of visitors. In releasing her concert movie, Swift bypassed studios and streamers, instead forging an unusual pact with AMC, giving the theater chain its highest single-day ticket sales in history. There are at least 10 college classes devoted to her, including one at Harvard; the professor, Stephanie Burt, tells TIME she plans to compare Swift’s work to that of the poet William Words-worth. Friendship bracelets traded by her fans at concerts became a hot accessory, with one line in a song causing as much as a 500% increase in sales at craft stores. When Swift started dating Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chief and two-time Super Bowl champion, his games saw a massive increase in viewership. (Yes, she somehow made one of America’s most popular things—football—even more popular.) And then there’s her critically hailed songbook—a catalog so beloved that as she rereleases it, she’s often breaking chart records she herself set. She’s the last monoculture left in our stratified world.

It’s hard to see history when you’re in the middle of it, harder still to distinguish Swift’s impact on the culture from her celebrity, which emits so much light it can be blinding. But something unusual is happening with Swift, without a contemporary precedent. She deploys the most efficient medium of the day—the pop song—to tell her story. Yet over time, she has harnessed the power of the media, both traditional and new, to create something wholly unique—a narrative world, in which her music is just one piece in an interactive, shape-shifting story. Swift is that story’s architect and hero, protagonist and narrator.

This was the year she perfected her craft—not just with her music, but in her position as the master storyteller of the modern era. The world, in turn, watched, clicked, cried, danced, sang along, swooned, caravanned to stadiums and movie theaters, let her work soundtrack their lives. For Swift, it’s a peak. “This is the proudest and happiest I’ve ever felt, and the most creatively fulfilled and free I’ve ever been,” Swift tells me. “Ultimately, we can convolute it all we want, or try to overcomplicate it, but there’s only one question.” Here, she adopts a booming voice. “Are you not entertained?”

A few months before I sit with Swift in New York, on a summer night in Santa Clara, Calif., which has been temporarily renamed Swiftie Clara in her honor, I am in a stadium with nearly 70,000 other people having a religious experience. The crowd is rapturous and Swift beatific as she gazes out at us, all high on the same drug. Her fans are singularly passionate, not just in the venue but also online, as they analyze clues, hints, and secret messages in everything from her choreography to her costumes—some deliberately planted, others not. (“Taylor Swift fans are the modern-day equivalent of those cults who would consistently have inaccurate rapture predictions like once a month,” as one viral tweet noted.)

Standing in the arena, it’s not hard to understand why this is the biggest thing in the world. “Beatlemania and Thriller have nothing on these shows,” says Swift’s friend and collaborator Phoebe Bridgers. Fans in Argentina pitched tents outside the venue for months to get prime spots, with some quitting their jobs to commit to fandom full time. Across the U.S., others lined up for days, while those who didn’t get in “Taylor-gated” in nearby parking lots so they could pick up the sound. When tickets went on sale last year, Ticketmaster crashed. Although 4.1 million tickets were sold for the 2023 shows—including over 2 million on the first day, a new record—scalpers jacked up prices on the secondary market to more than $22,000. Multiple fans filed lawsuits. The Justice Department moved forward with an investigation. The Senate held a hearing. Given these stakes, Swift had to deliver.

“I knew this tour was harder than anything I’d ever done before by a long shot,” Swift says. Each show spans over 180 minutes, including 40-plus songs from at least nine albums; there are 16 costume changes, pyrotechnics, an optical illusion in which she appears to dive into the stage and swim, and not one but two cottagecore worlds, which feature an abundance of moss.


In the past, Swift jokes, she toured “like a frat guy.” This time, she began training six months ahead of the first show. “Every day I would run on the treadmill, singing the entire set list out loud,” she said. “Fast for fast songs, and a jog or a fast walk for slow songs.” Her gym, Dogpound, created a program for her, incorporating strength, conditioning, and weights. “Then I had three months of dance training, because I wanted to get it in my bones,” she says. “I wanted to be so over-rehearsed that I could be silly with the fans, and not lose my train of thought.” She worked with choreographer Mandy Moore—recommended by her friend Emma Stone, who worked with Moore on La La Land—since, as Swift says, “Learning choreography is not my strong suit.” With the exception of Grammy night—which was “hilarious,” she says—she also stopped drinking. “Doing that show with a hangover,” she says ominously. “I don’t want to know that world.”

Swift’s arrival in a city energized the local economy. When Eras kicked off in Glendale, Ariz., she generated more revenue for its businesses than the 2023 Super Bowl, which was held in the same stadium. Fans flew across the country, stayed in hotels, ate meals out, and splurged on everything from sweatshirts to limited-edition vinyl, with the average Eras attendee reportedly spending nearly $1,300. Swift sees the expense and effort incurred by fans as something she needs to repay: “They had to work really hard to get the tickets,” she says. “I wanted to play a show that was longer than they ever thought it would be, because that makes me feel good leaving the stadium.” The “Taylor effect” was noticed at the highest levels of government. “When the Federal Reserve mentions you as the reason economic growth is up, that’s a big deal,” says Ed Tiryakian, a finance professor at Duke University.

Carrying an economy on your back is a lot for one person. After she plays a run of shows, Swift takes a day to rest and recover. “I do not leave my bed except to get food and take it back to my bed and eat it there,” she says. “It’s a dream scenario. I can barely speak because I’ve been singing for three shows straight. Every time I take a step my feet go crunch, crunch, crunch from dancing in heels.” Maintaining her strength through workouts between shows is key. “I know I’m going on that stage whether I’m sick, injured, heartbroken, uncomfortable, or stressed,” she says. “That’s part of my identity as a human being now. If someone buys a ticket to my show, I’m going to play it unless we have some sort of force majeure.” (A heat wave in Rio de Janeiro caused chaos during Swift’s November run as one fan, Ana Clara Benevides Machado, reportedly collapsed during the show and later died; Swift wrote on Instagram that she had a “shattered heart.” She rescheduled the next show because of unsafe conditions, and spent time with Benevides Machado’s family at her final tour date in Brazil.)


Swift is many things onstage—vulnerable and triumphant, playful and sad—but the intimacy of her songcraft is front and center. “Her work as a songwriter is what speaks most clearly to me,” says filmmaker Greta Gerwig, whose feminist Barbie was its own testament to the idea that women can be anything. “To write music that is from the deepest part of herself and have it directly speak into the souls of other people.” As Swift whips through the eras, she’s not trying to update her old songs, whether the earnest romance of “You Belong With Me” or the millennial ennui of “22,” so much as she is embracing them anew. She’s modeling radical self-acceptance on the world’s largest stage, giving the audience a space to revisit their own joy or pain, once dismissed or forgotten. I tell Swift that the show made me think of a meme that says, “Do not kill the part of you that is cringe—kill the part of you that cringes.” “Yes!” she exclaims. “Every part of you that you’ve ever been, every phase you’ve ever gone through, was you working it out in that moment with the information you had available to you at the time. There’s a lot that I look back at like, ‘Wow, a couple years ago I might have cringed at this.’ You should celebrate who you are now, where you’re going, and where you’ve been.”

Getting to this place of harmony with her past took work; there’s a dramatic irony, she explains, to the success of the tour. “It’s not lost on me that the two great catalysts for this happening were two horrendous things that happened to me,” Swift says, and this is where the story takes a turn. “The first was getting canceled within an inch of my life and sanity,” she says plainly. “The second was having my life’s work taken away from me by someone who hates me.”


Swift shows me some things she loves in her apartment: a Stevie Nicks Barbie that sits still boxed in her kitchen, sent to her by the artist; the framed note from Paul McCartney that hangs in her bathroom; tiles around the fireplace that Swift found shopping in Paris with her mother. Connections to her family are everywhere, including a striking photo of her grandmother Marjorie, an opera singer and the inspiration for a track on her album evermore. Swift grew up on a Christmas-tree farm in Pennsylvania, with her younger brother Austin; her father Scott was a stockbroker at Merrill Lynch, and Andrea worked in marketing. Her family still works closely with her today. “My dad, my mom, and my brother come up with some of the best ideas in my career,” Swift says. “I always joke that we’re a small family business.”

After moving to Nashville as a teen, she signed with Scott Borchetta’s Big Machine Records. Swift’s songwriting ability was evident from the first lyrics of “Tim McGraw,” her debut single: “He said the way my blue eyes shined put those Georgia stars to shame that night—I said, ‘That’s a lie.’” Even for country music these lyrics are literary—conjuring a romantic fantasy, then deflating it a line later. The fairy-tale promise of love and intimacy became a runner in Swift’s work as a songwriter, something she’d repeatedly espouse, then skewer; she was self-aware about the role narrative played in her expectations. She was seen as a gifted pop-country ingenue when, in a now infamous moment, Kanye West interrupted Swift onstage at the 2009 VMAs while she was accepting an award. The incident set in motion a chain of events that would shape the next decade of both artists’ lives.

It was around that time, Swift remembers now, that she began trying to shape-shift. “I realized every record label was actively working to try to replace me,” she says. “I thought instead, I’d replace myself first with a new me. It’s harder to hit a moving target.” Swift wrote songs solo, incorporated diverse sonic influences, and placed more clues about personal relationships in her lyrics and album materials for fans to decode. Her epic ballad “All Too Well,” from 2012’s Red, epitomizes Swift’s superpower as a songwriter, deploying tossed-off details like a forgotten scarf that comes back at the song’s end to stab you in the heart—but it also had a secret message hidden in the liner notes. When an extended version of the song hit No. 1 last year upon its rerelease, it wasn’t only because the song is extraordinary, but because it has its own lore, like Carly Simon’s “You’re So Vain” if it came with an experiential puzzle for fans to solve. “She’s like a whole room of writers as one person, with that voice and charisma,” Bridgers says. “She’s everything at once.”

Swift knew she had to keep innovating. “By the time an artist is mature enough to psychologically deal with the job, they throw you out at 29, typically,” she says. “In the ’90s and ’00s, it seems like the music industry just said: ‘OK, let’s take a bunch of teenagers, throw them into a fire, and watch what happens. By the time they’ve accumulated enough wisdom to do their job effectively, we’ll find new teenagers.’” She went full-throttle pop for 2014’s 1989, putting her on top of the world—“an imperial phase,” she calls it. She didn’t realize it would also give her much farther to fall. Public sentiment turned—sniping about everything from her perceived overexposure to conspiracy theories about her politics. “I had all the hyenas climb on and take their shots,” she says. West wrote a song with vulgar lyrics about her, and claimed that Swift had consented to it, which Swift denied; West’s then wife, Kim Kardashian, released a video of a conversation between West and Swift that seemed to indicate that Swift had been on board with the song. The scandal was tabloid catnip; it made Swift look like a snake, which is what people called her. She felt it was “a career death,” she says. “Make no mistake—my career was taken away from me.”

It was a bleak moment. “You have a fully manufactured frame job, in an illegally recorded phone call, which Kim Kardashian edited and then put out to say to everyone that I was a liar,” she says. “That took me down psychologically to a place I’ve never been before. I moved to a foreign country. I didn’t leave a rental house for a year. I was afraid to get on phone calls. I pushed away most people in my life because I didn’t trust anyone anymore. I went down really, really hard.” (Kardashian wrote, in a 2020 social media post, that the situation “forced me to defend him.”) Swift’s next album, 2017’s reputation, featured snake imagery; the video for “Look What You Made Me Do” saw her killing off younger versions of herself. She remembers reputation being met with uproar and skepticism. “I thought that moment of backlash was going to define me negatively for the rest of my life,” she says. She had also satisfied her record deal with Borchetta, and knew she wanted out. “The molecular chemistry of that old label was that every creative choice I wanted to make was second-guessed,” she says. “I was really overthinking these albums.”

She met with Lucian Grainge, the CEO of Universal Music Group, and Monte Lipman, who runs Universal’s top label Republic Records, to talk about signing a deal that would give her more agency. Today, Grainge is perhaps the most powerful executive in the music industry, but, as I sit with him in his office in Los Angeles, he describes himself as an “old punk” who operates on instinct more than metrics. He told Swift, he says, “We will utilize everything that we’ve got as a company for you.” Swift felt like she’d been given carte blanche: “Lucian and Monte basically said to me, ‘Whatever you turn in, we will be proud to put out. We give you 100% creative freedom and trust.’” It was exactly what she needed to hear most when the chips were down.

Yet the release of Swift’s first album with Republic, 2019’s Lover, coincided with the second big upheaval in her professional life: Borchetta had sold Big Machine—and with it, Swift’s catalog, valued then at a reported $140 million—to Ithaca Holdings, which is owned by music manager Scooter Braun, a former ally of West’s. “With the Scooter thing, my masters were being sold to someone who actively wanted them for nefarious reasons, in my opinion,” Swift says. (“It makes me sad that Taylor had that reaction to the deal,” Braun told Variety in 2021.) The sale meant that the rights to Swift’s first six albums moved to Braun, so whenever someone wanted to license one of those songs, he would be the one to profit. Swift rallied her fans against the deal, but still felt powerless. “I was so knocked on my ass by the sale of my music, and to whom it was sold,” she says. “I was like, ‘Oh, they got me beat now. This is it. I don’t know what to do.’”
 She went back to work, using the pandemic lockdown to pare back her sound on critically acclaimed albums folklore and evermore.

Around the same time, she started thinking about rerecording her old albums in an effort to wrest back control.
 “I’d run into Kelly Clarkson and she would go, ‘Just redo it,’” Swift says. “My dad kept saying it to me too. I’d look at them and go, ‘How can I possibly do that?’ Nobody wants to redo their homework if on the way to school, the wind blows your book report away.” Since Swift wrote her own songs, she retained the musical composition copyright and could rerecord them.
 She also negotiated to own the master rights for her material when she moved over to Republic in 2018, so she now owns her new material and the rerecorded songs. (Major labels have since made it more difficult for artists to rerecord their music.) She began rerecording subtly different versions of her old albums, tagging them “(Taylor’s Version)” and adding unreleased tracks to redirect listenership to them. She frames the strategy as a coping mechanism. “It’s all in how you deal with loss,” she says. “I respond to extreme pain with defiance.”



Grainge calls the rerecording project “bizarrely brilliant and unique”—something that only an artist at her level could pull off. “It’s got such a narrative—there’s a reason for it.” He shakes his head. “Imagine Picasso painting something that he painted a few years ago, then re-creating it with the colors of today.” Part of the success story, Swift says, is the freedom she received from the label to follow her instincts. “If you look at what I’ve put out since then, it’s more albums in the last few years than I did in the first 15 years of my career,” she says. That prolific output has fueled her ascension. “She could serve two terms as President of the United States and then go to Las Vegas,” Grainge says. “Who else can do that?”

In the grand narrative of Swift’s life, as she rose this year, her foes’ fortunes also seemed to turn. Over the summer, it was reported that several of Braun’s key clients—chief among them Justin Bieber and Ariana Grande—were no longer being managed by his company, while West’s antisemitic and other offensive remarks led to his losing key endorsement deals. Swift knows firsthand that fame is a seesaw. “Nothing is permanent,” she says. “So I’m very careful to be grateful every second that I get to be doing this at this level, because I’ve had it taken away from me before. There is one thing I’ve learned: My response to anything that happens, good or bad, is to keep making things. Keep making art.” She considers. “But I’ve also learned there’s no point in actively trying to quote unquote defeat your enemies,” she says. “Trash takes itself out every single time.”


The premiere for Swift’s concert film takes place at the Grove, an outdoor mall in Los Angeles, which has been shut down for the event; Swift has packed 13 screens with thousands of fans. She goes, one by one, to each theater thanking sobbing audience members for being there. Like the tour, the film, which was released directly to theaters without a traditional partner, is an event. “We met with all the studios,” she tells me, “and we met with all the streamers, and we sized up how it was perceived and valued, and if they had high hopes and dreams for it. Ultimately I did what I tend to do more and more often these days, which is to bet on myself.” She credits her father with the idea. “He just said, why does there have to be a—for lack of a better word—middleman?”

In the theater excitement ripples through the crowd, a mix of fans and Swift’s friends, as we wait for her. To my left are two dedicated Swifties, sisters who introduce themselves as Madison, 23, and McCall, 20, and who are still reeling from taking a selfie with Swift on the red carpet. Their wrists are covered in friendship bracelets, some of which are deep cuts—such as no it’s bECKY, a reference to a beloved Tumblr meme, and BLEACHELLA STAN, for Swift’s 2016 platinum blond bob—and Madison reveals a tattoo on her forearm that says “Taylor’s Version.” Both tell me their favorite album is reputation. They are my favorite people I have ever met, and I want to talk to only them for the rest of my life. Madison admires Swift for her vulnerability—“which is insane, when she’s under endless scrutiny”—while McCall cites her consistency, which she calls “a lost art form.” When I ask how McCall feels about Swift’s romantic life, she fields the question elegantly. “It’s a disservice to her to focus on that stuff,” she says. “She’s so good at making her personal experience relate to millions of people. When I listen to her songs, I think about what I’ve been through—not what she’s been through.”

Swift’s private life has long served as both grist for the tabloid mill and inspiration for her own work; she split from her longtime boyfriend, actor Joe Alwyn, earlier this year. Most recently, she’s been dating the NFL star Travis Kelce, as has been well documented when she attends his games. “I don’t know how they know what suite I’m in,” she says. “There’s a camera, like, a half-mile away, and you don’t know where it is, and you have no idea when the-camera is putting you in the broadcast, so I don’t know if I’m being shown 17 times or once.” She is sensitive to the attention that’s put on her when she shows up. “I’m just there to support Travis,” she says. “I have no awareness of if I’m being shown too much and pissing off a few dads, Brads, and Chads.”

I point out that it’s a net positive for the NFL to have a few Swifties watching. “Football is awesome, it turns out,” Swift says playfully. “I’ve been missing out my whole life.” (A game she attended in October was the most-watched Sunday show since the Super Bowl.)

Given her complex history with public interest in her dating life, I say, it seems noteworthy that her relationship with Kelce has played out so publicly. Swift gently pushes back: “This all started when Travis very adorably put me on blast on his podcast, which I thought was metal as hell,” she says. “We started hanging out right after that. So we actually had a significant amount of time that no one knew, which I’m grateful for, because we got to get to know each other. By the time I went to that first game, we were a couple. I think some people think that they saw our first date at that game? We would never be psychotic enough to hard launch a first date.” The larger point, for her, is that there’s nothing to hide. “When you say a relationship is public, that means I’m going to see him do what he loves, we’re showing up for each other, other people are there and we don’t care,” she says. “The opposite of that is you have to go to an extreme amount of effort to make sure no one knows that you’re seeing someone. And we’re just proud of each other.”

Swift’s openness is one part of why her fan base leans heavily, though not exclusively, female. The Eras Tour was one critical piece of what Swift calls “a three-part summer of feminine extravaganza”—the other two parts being Gerwig’s box-office bonanza Barbie and Beyoncé’s blockbuster, culture-shifting Renaissance Tour. “To make a fun, entertaining blast of a movie, with that commentary,” she says of Barbie, “I cannot imagine how hard that was, and Greta made it look so easy.” (“I’m just a sucker for a gal who is good with words, and she is the best with them,” Gerwig says about Swift, whom she calls “Bruce Springsteen meets Loretta Lynn meets Bob Dylan.”)

Swift is no less effusive in talking about Beyoncé, who brokered a similar deal with AMC and shows up to Swift’s Los Angeles premiere; the next month, Swift returns the favor by attending Beyoncé’s in London. “She’s the most precious gem of a person—warm and open and funny,” Swift says. “And she’s such a great disrupter of music-industry norms. She taught every artist how to flip the table and challenge archaic business practices.” That her tour and Beyoncé’s were frequently juxtaposed is vexing. “There were so many stadium tours this summer, but the only ones that were compared were me and Beyoncé,” she says. “Clearly it’s very lucrative for the media and stan culture to pit two women against each other, even when those two artists in question refuse to participate in that discussion.”

To Swift, the success of all three feels like an inflection point. “If we have to speak stereotypically about the feminine and the masculine,” she says, “women have been fed the message that what we naturally gravitate toward—” She has a few examples: “Girlhood, feelings, love, breakups, analyzing those feelings, talking about them nonstop, glitter, sequins! We’ve been taught that those things are more frivolous than the things that stereotypically gendered men gravitate toward, right?” Right, I say. “And what has existed since the dawn of time? A patriarchal society. What fuels a patriarchal society? Money, flow of revenue, the economy. So actually, if we’re going to look at this in the most cynical way possible, feminine ideas becoming lucrative means that more female art will get made. It’s extremely heartening.”

Amid so much attention, it seems noteworthy that Swift appears more relaxed in the public eye, not less—although I wonder out loud whether it just appears that way. She nods. “Over the years, I’ve learned I don’t have the time or bandwidth to get pressed about things that don’t matter. Yes, if I go out to dinner, there’s going to be a whole chaotic situation outside the restaurant. But I still want to go to dinner with my friends.” She sounds thoughtful. “Life is short. Have adventures. Me locking myself away in my house for a lot of years—I’ll never get that time back. I’m more trusting now than I was six years ago.”

She’s also having more fun. At her premiere, Swift sits in the same row as me, Madison, and McCall, singing along and dancing in her seat; we keep craning our necks to look at her, sharing thunderstruck looks: Isn’t this surreal? There are moments in the film when the cameras capture the enormous screens behind Swift onstage, and it feels like a house of mirrors, these myriad reflections of Taylor Swift—us watching her watch herself on a screen, which is itself showing Swift’s image on so many screens, the thousands of fans onscreen in the stadium and us in this theater, with Swift in the middle of it—all of us rapt, unable to look away.

Swift and I have been talking for a while now at her apartment, long enough that our coffees have gone cold and her cat Benjamin Button has trundled into the room, then gotten bored and left. She tells me about revisiting reputation, which is perhaps the most charged era in the tour. “It’s a goth-punk moment of female rage at being gaslit by an entire social structure,” she says, laughing. “I think a lot of people see it and they’re just like, Sick snakes and strobe lights.” The upcoming vault tracks for reputation will be “fire,” she promises. The rerecordings project feels like a mythical quest to her. “I’m collecting horcruxes,” she says. “I’m collecting infinity stones. Gandalf’s voice is in my head every time I put out a new one. For me, it is a movie now.”


It strikes me then that for all the talk about eras, it’s also worth thinking about genres—how Swift has moved between them in the stories she’s told. At first, it was a coming-of-age story, one about a young woman finding her way in the world and honing her voice before a fickle public. Then there were romances, great ones—tales of enchantment and desire, heartbreak and disillusionment, relationships that she both excavated for her songs and that the media documented for her with either joy or schadenfreude, depending on the day. There have been dramas with stakes so high and turns so twisty they feel Shakespearean in their scope, betrayals both personal and professional that have shaped her life. Occasionally, these stories have tipped into screwball comedy—like when a crowd in Seattle cheered so loudly it registered as an earthquake, or when, on a tour stop in Brazil, the local archdiocese allowed messages celebrating her to be projected onto the 124-ft. Christ the Redeemer statue
. But they have one thing in common: Swift.

She is a maestro of self-determination, of writing her own story. The multihyphenate television creator Shonda Rhimes—no stranger to a plot twist—who has known Swift since she was a teenager, puts it simply: “She controls narrative not only in her work, but in her life,” she says. “It used to feel like people were taking shots at her. Now it feels like she’s providing the narrative—so there aren’t any shots to be taken.”

Here, Swift has told me a story about redemption, about rising and falling only to rise again—a hero’s journey. I do not say to her, in our conversation, that it did not always look that way from the outside—that, for example, when reputation’s lead single “Look What You Made Me Do” reached No. 1 on the charts, or when the album sold 1.3 million albums in the first week, second only to 1989, she did not look like someone whose career had died. She looked like a superstar who was mining her personal experience as successfully as ever. I am tempted to say this.

But then I think, Who am I to challenge it, if that’s how she felt? The point is: she felt canceled. She felt as if her career had been taken from her. Something in her had been lost, and she was grieving it. Maybe this is the real Taylor Swift effect: That she gives people, many of them women, particularly girls, who have been conditioned to accept dismissal, gaslighting, and mistreatment from a society that treats their emotions as inconsequential, permission to believe that their interior lives matter. That for your heart to break, whether it’s from being kicked off a tour or by the memory of a scarf still sitting in a drawer somewhere or because somebody else controls your life’s work, is a valid wound, and no, you’re not crazy for being upset about it, or for wanting your story to be told.

After all, not to be corny, haven’t we all become selective autobiographers in the digital age as we curate our lives for our own audiences of any size—cutting away from the raw fabric of our lived experience to reveal the shape of the story we most want to tell, whether it’s on our own feeds or the world’s stage? I can’t blame her for being better at it than everyone else. It’s also not like she hasn’t admitted it. She sang it herself, in her song “Mastermind,” off last year’s Midnights, in a bridge so feathery you could almost miss that it marks some of the rawest, most naked songwriting of her career: “No one wanted to play with me as a little kid/ So I’ve been scheming like a criminal ever since/ To make them love me and make it seem effortless/ This is the first time I’ve felt the need to confess/ And I swear I’m only cryptic and Machiavellian because I care.”

She tells me she wrote that song after watching the Paul Thomas Anderson film Phantom Thread, which—spoiler—culminates in the reveal of a vast, layered manipulation. “Remember that last scene?” she says. “I thought, wouldn’t it be fun to have a lyric about being calculated?” She pauses. “It’s something that’s been thrown at me like a dagger, but now I take it as a compliment.”

It is a compliment. After I leave Swift’s house, I can’t stop thinking about how perfectly she crafted this story for me—the one about redemption, how she lost it all and got it back. Storytelling is what she’s always done; that’s why, Chesney tells me, he gave her that gift all those years ago. “She was a writer who had something to say,” he says. “That isn’t something you can fake by writing clichés. You can only live it, then write it as real as possible.”

She must have known that all the references she made had hidden meanings, that I’d see all the tossed-off details for the Easter eggs they were. The way she told me that story about Chesney, she knew there was a lesson, about the power of generosity, and how a crushing defeat can give way to a great and surprising gift. The way she said, “Are you not entertained?”—surely we both knew it was a quote from Gladiator, a movie in which a hero falls from grace, is forced to perform blood sport for the pleasure of spectators, and emerges victorious, having survived humiliation and debasement to soar higher than ever. And the way before I left, she showed me the note from Paul McCartney hanging in her bathroom, which has a Beatles lyric written on it—and not just any Beatles lyric, but this one: “Take these broken wings and learn to fly.” —With reporting by Leslie Dickstein and Megan McCluskey"

I Think He Knows (Live from Taylor Swift | The Eras Tour) Lyrics
[Intro]
And it's called ""I Think He Knows""

[Verse 1]
I think he knows
His footsteps on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night
I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands

[Chorus]
He got that heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows


[Verse 2]
I think he knows
When we gеt all alone
I'll make myself at homе
And he'll want me to stay
I think he knows
He'd better lock it down
'Cause I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait

[Pre-Chorus]
He got that boyish look that I like in a man
I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans
He's so obsessed with me and, boy, I understand
Boy, I understand

[Chorus]
He got that heartbeat
Skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you
I want you, bless my soul
I want you
I want you


[Bridge]
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
I can handle the sparks, I'll drive
Lyrical smile, indigo eyes, hand on my thigh
You could follow the sparks, I'll drive
""So where we wanna go?""
I whisper in the dark
""Where we wanna go?""
I think he knows

[Chorus]
And I'm skipping down 16th Avenue
Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows
I think he knows

[Post-Chorus]
I want you
I want you, bless my soul
I want you
I want you, got my
Heartbeat skipping down 16th Avenue
And I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows"

Let’s Go Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The first shots fired, everybody's gathered around
You're looking at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, that's not what happened at all
There's no sound, I'm waitin' on your next move
A showdown, and I know where to hit you
But no, no, it's not how I wanted this to go down

[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're standin' in the ring and you make the first swing
And now we're fightin' dirty
Won't somebody come say “Break it up?”

[Chorus]
And I used to be on your side, now it's lookin' like we're goin' to battle
And why, you takin' shots at me like somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I (Oh-oh) never wanna hurt you, but I'm tired of takin' all these blows (Ah-ah)
And so, I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight, baby let's go
Oh-oh-oh, let's go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
So gloves off, if this how you want it
We had it all, but you couldn't keep a promise
No, no, no, I'm not the one who tore us apart
Let me remind you for a minute why we're not fine
Is she, is she standin' on the sidelines?
Oh, oh, can't you tell this is breakin' my heart?


[Pre-Chorus]
Now we're standin' in the ring and you make the first swing
And now I'm fightin' dirty
But I ain't goin' down 'til they break it up

[Chorus]
And I used to be on your side, now it's lookin' like we're goin' to battle
And why, you takin' shots at me like somebody's gonna give you a medal?
And I (Oh-oh) never wanna hurt you, but I'm tired of takin' all these blows (Ah-ah)
And so, I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight, let's go
Oh-oh-oh, let's go
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Now we're standin' in the ring breaking everything that we've been buildin' up so long
And I don't wanna do this, break it up
But you're not who I thought you were
And this is looking more like a war
(Like a war, oh-oh, like a war)
(Like a war, oh) Looks like we're goin' to war
(War, like a war, we're goin' to war)
Oh-oh (Like a war)

[Chorus]
And I used to be on your side, now it's lookin' like we're goin' to battle
And I'm tryin' not to break down cryin'
No one's gonna give you a medal
And I (Oh-oh) never wanna hurt you, but I'm tired of takin' all these blows (Ah-ah)
And so, I'd rather be on your side
I'd rather be on your side
But if you wanna fight, baby let's go
Oh-oh-oh, looks like we're goin' to war
Oh


[Outro]
The first shots fired, everybody's gathered around
You're lookin' at me like I tried to take you down
No, no, but if you wanna fight, baby let's go (Let's go)"

Dress Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Our secret moments in a crowded room
They got no idea about me and you
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Made your mark on me, a golden tattoo

[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Verse 2]
Inescapable, I'm not even gonna try
And if I get burned, at least we were electrified
I'm spilling wine in the bathtub
You kiss my face and we're both drunk
Everyone thinks that they know us
But they know nothin' about


[Pre-Chorus]
All of this silence and patience, pining and anticipation
My hands are shaking from holding back from you
Ha, ah, ah
All of this silence and patience, pining and desperately waiting
My hands are shaking from all this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha

[Post-Chorus]
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah, ha-ah-ah-ah
Only bought this dress so you could take it off

[Bridge]
Flashback when you met me, your buzzcut and my hair bleached
Even in my worst times, you could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes, my rebounds, my earthquakes
Even in my worst lies, you saw the truth in me
And I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My one and only, my lifeline
I woke up just in time, now I wake up by your side
My hands shake, I can't explain this
Ah, ha, ha, ha-ah


[Chorus]
Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah
Carve your name into my bedpost
'Cause I don't want you like a best friend
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
Take it off, ha, ha, ha-ah

[Outro]
There is an indentation in the shape of you
Only bought this dress so you could take it off
You made your mark on me, golden tattoo
Only bought this dress so you could take it off"

[Part I: Eras Tour Intro (Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince, The Alchemy, Fearless, End Game, Speak Now, gold rush, New Romantics, Bad Blood, The Tortured Poets Department, long story short, Red, Lavender Haze, Lover)]

[Verse]
It's been a long time coming...
It's been a long time coming...
It's been a long time... (It's you and me)
It's been a long time coming...
It's been a long time coming...
What if I told you I'm back?

It's Fearless

(It's you and me) It's been a long time coming...
Big reputation

It's been a long time coming...
And they said Speak Now

It's been a long time coming...
Into folklore

My name is Taylor and I was born in 1989!
 (Hey!)
Straight from The Tortured Poets Department

Evermore

It's been a long time...
Loving him was Red
 (It's been a long time coming...)
(Red, red)
(It's you and me)
Meet me at Midnight

Lover

(Nice!)

Lover


[Part II: Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince]

[Chorus]
It's been a long time coming, but
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away
(Voted most likely to run away)
Voted most likely to run away
(Voted most likely to run away)
With you

[Part III: Cruel Summer]

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more


[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you


{Speech}

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah) Cruel summer
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
It's a cruel summer
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)
With you (With you, with you, with you, with you)

Wildest Dreams Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of this city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can’t help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus 1]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you’ll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, haa

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now


[Pre-Chorus 2]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request, it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you’ll see me again
Even if it’s just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah haa (ah-aah haa)
Wildest dreams, ah-aah haa

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burnin’, burnin' it down
Someday when you leave me, I'd bet these memories
Will follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight, tangled up with you all night
Burning burning it down
Someday when you leave me, I’ll bet these memories
Follow you around
Follow you around


[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha (ah-aah-aah-aah-aah-ha)
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah-aah, ha"

My Own Worst Anti-Hero Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
Please tell me why my car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night (And you're gone)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism
I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
Please tell me why my car is in the front yard
And I'm sleeping with my clothes on
I came in through the window last night (And you're gone)
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Blank Space Lyrics
Nice to meet you
Where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought oh my gosh
Look at that face, you look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make the bad guys good for a weekend

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name


Cherry lips
Crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king baby I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
But the worst is yet to come
Oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I could make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like oh my god
Who is she? I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
Cause darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game


Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far and leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name

Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn you
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't say I didn't warn you

So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far and leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space baby
And I'll write your name"

Mastermind (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time

[Pre-Chorus]
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose

[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

[Verse 2]
You see, all the wisest women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game


[Pre-Chorus]
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails

[Chorus]
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind

[Bridge]
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
'Cause I care


[Chorus]
So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind"

Stay Beautiful (Commentary) Lyrics
Becca: Thank you for listening to Big Machine Radio as we celebrate the twelve-year anniversary of the release of Taylor Swift's self-titled debut album. I am Becca and, you know, it's been over a decade that Taylor has been connecting with people through her songwriting, and one of the things that I have always just been blown away about Taylor's writing are the details and the imagery that she includes. In fact, a lot of people who wanted to become songwriters often ask Taylor for advice and that's kind of what she tells them

Taylor Swift: My advice to first-time songwriters would be, you know, the person you're writing the song about, first know that, and then write a letter to them, like, what you would say if you could, 'cause that's why I listen to music, it's because it says how I feel better than I could and it says what I wish I'd said when that moment was there. So, I would say, be as direct as you possibly can. If you needed to rewrite it back later, I guess do that, but, for me, I think the more details, the better. The more it seems like a journal entry, the better. The more it seems like an open letter, the better. The more true and honest and real it gets, where you're naming the places you were, the times it happened, all the things about a relationship. If you can, in your songwriting, be as detailed as possible, because, for people to relate to it, they may not have the same details in their relationship that you had in yours, but they can relate in that they had these little details to their relationship, too

Becca: In fact, I know a lot of people connected to the details of this next song that we're about to play off Taylor Swift's debut album. This is ""Stay Beautiful"" on Big Machine Radio"

Mean Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again


[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean


[Breakdown]
But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean, yeah

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"

Teardrops on My Guitar (Original Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in thе car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tеll that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


[Pre-Chorus]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile, so he won't see"

And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you"

Why is it Even Bitcrushed Lol Lyrics
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew

I was enchanted to meet you"

Tolerate it/ Writer in the dark Lyrics
[Verse 1:]
I sit and watch you reading with your head low
I wake and watch you breathing with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser and I

[Verse 2:]
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark
Now she's gonna play and sing and lock you in her heart
Bet you rue the day you kissed a writer in the dark

[Verse 3:]
Cause I-I-I
Wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the tables with the fancy shit
And watch you tolеrate it

[Chorus:]
Cause I am my mother's child
I'll lovе you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours I stumble on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe


[Verse 4:]
While you were out building other worlds where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm begging for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawing hearts on the bylines
Always taking up too much space, or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I

[Verse 5:]
Break free and leave us in ruins?
Took this dagger in me and removed it?
Gain the weight of you and lose it
Believe me, I could do it

[Chorus:]
If it's all in my head tell me now ('Cause I am my mother's child)
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow (I'll love you til my breathing stops)
I know my love should be celebrated ('Cause I am my mother's child)
But you tolerate it (I'll love you til my breathing stops)

[Chorus:]
Cause I am my mother's child
I'll love you 'til my breathing stops
I'll love you 'til you call the cops on me
But in our darkest hours I stumble on a secret power
I'll find a way to be without you, babe"

Actually Romantic Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I heard you call me ""Boring Barbie"" when the coke's got you brave
High-fived my ex and then you said you're glad he ghosted me
Wrote me a song saying it makes you sick to see my face
Some people might be offended

[Chorus]
But it's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me
It's honestly wild
All the effort you've put in
It's actually romantic
I really gotta hand it to you
No man has ever loved me like you do

[Verse 2]
Hadn't thought of you in a long time
But you keep sending me funny valentines
And I know you think it comes off vicious
But it's precious, adorable
Like a toy chihuahua barking at me from a tiny purse
That's how much it hurts
How many times has your boyfriend said
""Why are we always talking about her?""

[Chorus]
It's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me
It's honestly wild
All the effort you've put in
It's actually romantic
I really gotta hand it to you
No man has ever loved me like you do


[Bridge]
You think I'm tacky, baby
Stop talking dirty to me
You sounded nasty, but it feels like you're flirting with me
I mind my business, God's my witness that I don't provoke it
My jaw dropped here when she said wet (Ooh)

[Chorus]
'Cause it's actually sweet
All the time you've spent on me
It's honestly lovely
All the effort you've put in
It's actually romantic
Really gotta hand it to you, to you
No man has ever loved me like you do

[Outro]
It's actually romantic (You've just given me so much attention)
It's actually romantic
No man has ever loved me like you do"

Picture To Burn (Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
State the obvious, I didn't get my perfect fantasy
I realize you love yourself more than you could ever love me
So go and tell your friends that I'm obsessive and crazy
That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way

[Chorus]
I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Verse 2]
There's no time for tears
I'm just sitting here planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match an all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


[Bridge]
And if you're missing me, you'd better keep it to yourself
'Cause coming back around here would be bad for your health

[Chorus]
'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
In case you haven't heard
I really really hate that
Stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak, who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn

[Outro]
Burn, burn, burn, baby, burn
You're just another picture to burn
Baby, burn"

Getaway Car Lyrics
[Intro]
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car


[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', ""Go, go, go!""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We're both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was Him for Himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart (Oh!)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car


[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (Oh-oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in (Oh-oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me (Oh!)

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far (Don't pretend)
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart (Should've known)
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Outro]
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car"

Should’ve Said No (Commentary) Lyrics
Becca: We are celebrating the dozen years that have passed since Taylor Swift released her self-titled debut album. And man, I can't believe that it has been that long, and to think about how far Taylor Swift has come in those twelve years. And you know, one of the things that has set Taylor apart in her carreer is her intelligence and her business savvy and knowing who she is as an artist, and even when she was younger, just fifteen, sixteen years old, Taylor knew that it wouldn't be good enough just to cute and be able to do things

Taylor Swift: There are girls in Nashville who are gorgeous and they have amazing voices and wanted to do the same thing that I wanted to do, and I figured out a way to stand out. And, for me, I went back home and I started playing guitar and writing my own music and, in that sense, I could walk into a room and play my own instrument and I could play songs that I've written and, that way, I wouldn't have to depend on anybody creatively

Becca: Taylor Swift has certainly embraced that creative freedom with a vengeance and she has gone on to just make some absolutely incredible music. But today, we are celebrating the beginning, the songs that captivated people when they were so young and have led them to become lifelong Taylor fans. And I know a lot of us have sung along to this one at the top of our lungs, feel free to go ahead and do it again. This is ""Should've Said No"" from Taylor Swift on Big Machine Radio"

Od dechy do dechy Lyrics
Zgodnie z przemijaniem wszystko gra
Od dechy do dechy oddechy
Ostatnie tchnienia westchnień otchłanie
Zachwytu głębie przestworza

Zgodnie z przemijaniem wszystko gra
Wykwintne kwieciste obfite
Ostatnie tchnienia westchnień otchłanie
Od dechy do dechy życie trwa

Tak mało chwil...tak mało mamy chwil...

Zgodnie z przemijaniem wszystko gra
Cętkowane złotem świetliście
Skrzące bajkowe bańki mydlane
Liczne mieniące ale mdłe

Tak mało chwil..tak mało mamy chwil..."

Love Story (Digital Dog Radio Mix) Lyrics
[Intro]
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""


[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while

[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you please don't go and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


[Pre-Chorus]
And I said: ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, said, said, said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes""

[Outro]
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""yes"""

Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends

And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Verse 1: Getaway Car]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him

[Pre-Chorus: Getaway Car]
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We nеver had a shotgun shot in the dark

[Chorus: Getaway Car]
You werе drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
I shoulda known l'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car


[Verse 2: Getaway Car]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
Well, he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', ""go, go, go!""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (we're both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus: Getaway Car]
X marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun, shot to the heart

[Chorus: Getaway Car]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
I shoulda known l'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Chorus: august]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August slipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Bridge: Getaway Car]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde (oh, oh)
Until I switched to the other side
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in (oh, oh)
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

[Chorus: Getaway Car]
Drivin' the getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
(should've known)
I shoulda' known l'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car


[Outro: Getaway Car]
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car

[Outro: The Other Side Of The Door]
With your face and the beautiful eyes
And the conversation with the little white lies
And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?
After everything and that little black dress
After everything I must confess, I need you"

Fearless (Commentary) Lyrics
[Becca]
I'm Becca with Big Machine radio and we are taking a look back at Taylor Swift’s album Fearless, which was released 10 years ago this fall
And so for this special we're gonna hear from Taylor, kind of a flashback to when she released this album, what she was thinking when she wrote the songs and you'll hear every song on that album
We’re gonna start with the title track because that's track one on the album, and here's what Taylor said about about choosing this title for her album

[Taylor Swift]
Fearless to me, I thought about it before we titled the album that, because you really have to make sure it explains this body of work that your putting out
For the last two years of stories you want to tell, so I thought about it, and I thought about what my own personal definition of the word fearless is, and to me, fearless isn't not having any fears, it's not that you're not afraid of anything
I think that being fearless means that you have a lot of fears, but you jump anyways"

Cruel Summer (LP Giobbi Remix - Extended Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feelin' I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Post-Chorus]
With you
With you
With you


[Chorus]
New, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feelin' I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right)

[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feelin' I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you
New, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feelin' I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you


[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

[Outro]
It's
Ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's
Ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feelin' I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you"

Tied Together With A Smile (Commentary) Lyrics
Becca: Thanks for listening to Big Machine Radio. Hey there, I'm Becca, and we are celebrating the milestones in Taylor Swift's carreer because she releases albums in the fall, generally, so right around this time, there was a lot to celebrate. Right now, we are celebrating the twelve-year anniversary of the release of hеr debut album, it happened Octobеr 24th, 2006. Man, I would imagine, as an artist, to know that your music has that kind of an impact on people, it must be incredible. And Taylor does talk about what inspired this really powerful song that so many people were impacted by, ""Tied Together With A Smile.""

Taylor Swift: One of my best friends is this really pageant queen, you know, beauty queen, everybody wants to be her, all the guys want to date her, and, um, I wrote this song the day that I found out that she had an eating disorder. You know, it's kind of a haughty point in your life when you realize that something that you thought was so strong, you find out that it isn't strong at all, and that she, you know, had a deadly problem. And, um, so, it was a really tough time that I wrote that song and helped her through it, and she's fine now, so it's good

Becca: And, you know, that's part of the message in this song, that even if you're not okay now, you will be okay, so just hang in there. And this is ""Tied Together With A Smile"" on Big Machine Radio"

Eyes Open Lyrics
[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 1]
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 2]
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just got to keep your eyes open


[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

[Bridge]
Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

[Outro]
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open"

Sweet Nothing (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'

[Verse 2]
On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, ""What a mind""
This happens all the time
Ooh, ooh

[Chorus]
'Causе they said the end is comin'
Evеryone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'


[Bridge]
Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that I'm just too soft for all of it
Ooh

[Chorus]
They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
They said the end is comin' (They said the end is comin')
Everyone's up to somethin' (Everyone's up to somethin')
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin' (Outside, they're push and shovin')
You're in the kitchen hummin' (You're in the kitchen hummin')
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'"

God Bless the Children Lyrics
Somewhere
I bet he sits all alone
Waiting again tonight for mommy to come home
She says she has bills to pay
That he’s only in her way
Listen close can’t you hear him crying?

I need someone who needs  me
I need someone who loves me

Somewhere I bet there’s a little girl being scared
Hungry is part of her world
Her daddy came home mad again
She’ll just say she fell again
Listen close can’t you hear her crying ?
I need someone who needs me
I need someone who loves me

God bless the children
Guide them and lead them
Listen close, can’t you hear them crying?

I need someone who needs me
I need someone who loves me
I need someone who needs me
I need someone who loves me"

False God Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
Into the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
(We'd still worship)
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love


[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
(We'd still worship)
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love"

The Outside (Commentary) Lyrics
Becca: We are celebrating the twelve-year anniversary of the release of Taylor Swift's self-titled debut album and it has been an incredible twelve years, to say the least. You know, there are many songs on Taylor Swift's debut CD that people latched on to or related to, it's probably because she was willing to open up and share her personal feelings about what she was going through, and so many people were in that exact same position, going through that exact situation when they were in school and, for Taylor, it was a very true and honest story

Taylor Swift: I wrote the song ""The Outside"" and it was when I was, um, youngers and stuff in middle school. I wasn't accepted, I was kind of an outcast, on the outside looking in, and I wrote that song about it. And I thought it was important to include it on the album because I wasn't always in this position. I didn't always have a lot of people around me, and I think it's important to remember where you came from and remember when you weren't on top of the world

Becca: Like so many of her songs, a lot of people turn to Taylor Swift's ""The Outside"" to help them navegate the waters when it didn't quite feel like they belonged"

ME! Lyrics
[Intro: Rye]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Jack & Brooklyn]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Andy]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Rye]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


[Verse 2: Andy, Brooklyn, & Jack]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus: Rye]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus: Andy]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge: Rye, Brooklyn, Jack, & Andy]
Wassup?
Spelling is fun!
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
I promise that you'll never find another like


[Chorus: Rye & Andy]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you (Y-Yeah)
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro: Jack, Andy, Brook, & Rye]
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a ""me""
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
You can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
You're the only one of you (No)
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e"

Untouchable (Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Untouchable like a distant diamond sky
I'm reaching out and I just can’t tell you why
I'm caught up in you, I'm caught up in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
And when you’re close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven

[Verse 2]
It's half full and I won't wait here all day
I know you're saying that you'd be here anyway

[Pre-Chorus]
But you’re untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you’re close, I feel like coming undone


[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It’s like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven


[Bridge]
I'm caught up in you
Oh, oh, oh

[Pre-Chorus]
But you’re untouchable, burning brighter than the sun
Now that you're close, I feel like coming undone

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, oh
In the middle of the night waking from this dream
I want to feel you by my side, standing next to me
You got to come on, come on, say that we'll be together
Come on, come on, little taste of heaven
And in the middle of the night when I'm in this dream
It's like a million little stars spelling out your name
You got to come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, oh, oh, oh


[Outro]
Like a million little stars spelling out your name
They're spelling out your name, oh"

That’s When (2008 Original) Lyrics
(Verse 1)
I said I know when he said I
Need some time, need some space
To think about all of this
And I watched him go
And he watched me
Crash to the floor on my knees just like that
He said when can I come back

(Chorus)
I said
That’s when, when I wake up in the morning
That’s when, when it’s sunny or storming
Laughing when I’m crying
And that’s when, I’ll be waiting at the front gate
When I see your face I’ll let you in
And baby that’s when

(Verse 2)
I said I know did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this
Cause I let you go
And you let me think that I’d be fine without you
Imagine that
So baby when can I come back


(Chorus)
And I said
That’s when, when I wake up in the morning
That’s when, when it’s sunny or storming
Laughing when I’m crying
And that’s when, I’ll be waiting at the front gate
When I see your face I’ll let you in
And baby that’s when

(Bridge)
And I said honestly
Did you ever think of me

(Chorus)
And he said
That’s when, when I woke up in the morning
That’s when, when it’s sunny or storming
Laughing when I was crying
And that’s when, you were waiting at the front gate
That’s when, When I saw your face
You let me in
And baby that’s when
That’s when, when I wake up in the morning
That’s when Oh oh oh
Oh oh
Oh-oh oh
Oh-oh oh
Oh


(Outro)
Baby that’s when
I said I know when he said I
Need some time, need some space"

Cruel Summer Lyrics
[Intro]
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you


[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinning like a devil


[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""

Anti-Hero / Better / Meet Me At Our Spot (Mixed) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Khalid]
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
(Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are)
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
(I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark)
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
(No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored)
'Cause I live down the street, so we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is

[Chorus: Khalid, Taylor Swift]
Nothing feels better than this
It's me, hi, I'm the problеm, it's me (I'm the problem, it's mе)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2: WILLOW]
When I wake up
I can't even stay up
I slept through the day, fuck
I'm not getting younger
But when I'm older
I'll be so much stronger
I'll stay up for longer
Meet me at our spot


[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Look What You Made Me Do Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play of the fool
No, I don't like you

[Verse 2]
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you madе me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just madе me-
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


[Verse 3]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (what?)

[Verse 4]
The world moves on, another day another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter
I got harder in the nick of time (Nick of time)
Honey, I rose up from the dead
I do it all the time (I do it all the time)
I got a list of names, and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me-
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


[Bridge 1]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

[Bridge 2]
I'm sorry
But the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me-
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me-
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do

Treacherous Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
Till the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quick sand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I like it

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone trained to get along
Forever going with the flow but you're friction

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I I I like it


[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home

[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home

[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I ...


[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I will follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home
I'll follow you follow you home, follow you follow you home

This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it"

Mean (The Voice Performance) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man

[Pre-Chorus]
You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Verse 2]
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again


[Pre-Chorus]
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But that cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

[Bridge]
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things

[Chorus]
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah, yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"

Teardrops on My Guitar (Live from SoHo) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I  fake a smile so he won't see
That  I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And  she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew  talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That  I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's  the reasons for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...


[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn out the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...


[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
Thank you"

Fifteen (Live at the Grammy Awards 2009) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you’re gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus: Miley Cyrus, Both]
'Cause when you’re fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothing to figure out
Wеll, count to ten, take it in
This is life bеfore you know who you're gonna be
At fifteen

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Both]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends (Woah, oh)
(Woah-oah)


[Bridge: Miley Cyrus, Taylor Swift, Both]
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
Then I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
We both cried

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Miley Cyrus, Both]
'Cause when you're fifteen, somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them (You're gonna believe them)
Fifteen, don’t forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen

[Outro: Miley Cyrus, Both]
Just take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"

There's something 'bout the way the street looks when it's just rained

There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Verse 2]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road in this one horse town
I wanna stay right here, in this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless


[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this

And I don't know why but with you I'd dance

Cold As You (Commentary) Lyrics
Becca: This is Big Machine Radio, and I think Swifties all over the world know that Taylor Swift likes to release her albums in the fall, usually October or November. That means, this time of year, there are so many milestones to celebrate when it comes to Taylor. In fact, right now, we're celebrating the twelve-year anniversary of the release of her debut album here on Big Machine Radio. Going back, examining some of the songs, and also hearing from Taylor. And, you know, one thing that set Taylor apart back when she was first getting started, you have to know that it was back when MySpace was actually popular, she decided to approach her biography on her MySpace page similar to the way that she approaches her songwriting — to be very open and personal and honest

Taylor Swift: I tried to write my biography not, you know, as somebody else was writing it. You know, a lot of artists have, ""So-and-so is the best, you know, musician ever,"" and I just didn't wanna have my biography be like that, so I decided to write mine in first person. Telling about who I am as a person, what I like, what I don't like, what annoys me, what I love, you know, stuff like that. 'Cause I always wanted my favorite artists to do that. I always thought it would've been cool if the Country artists that I looked up to when I was little would've given the fans something really cool. So I thought it was pretty cool to give these people information about me, 'cause I'm not scared of it

Becca: Well, it was that willingness to not be scared and to share herself with her fans that have endeared her to them for so long and, of course, the songs have also connected Taylor to her fans forever. I know this song has helped a lot of people find their way out of bad situations. This is ""Cold As You,"" Taylor Swift, on Big Machine Radio"

Lavender Haze Lyrics
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia

I've been under scrutiny
You handle it beautifully
All this shit is new to me

I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

All they keep asking me
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kind of girl they see
Is a one night or a wife

I find it dizzying
They're bringing up my history
But you weren't еven listening

I feel the lavеnder haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze"

The Story Of Us Lyrics
I used to think one day we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
People would say they're the lucky ones
I used to know my place was a spot next to you
Now I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on
Oh a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall-out
Too many things that I wish you knew
So many walls that I can't break through

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say, it's a twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
Next chapter
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
You're doing your best to avoid me
I started to think one day I'd tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I'd tell you I miss you but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud


[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say, it's a twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like the careless
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you say you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wished I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus:]
Now I'm standing alone in a crowded room and we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say, it's a twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speaking
And I'm dying to know is it killing you like it's killing me, yeah
I don't know what to say, it's a twist of fate 'cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Taylor Swift on “Bad Blood,” Kanye West, and How People Interpret Her Lyrics Lyrics
“That’s a pap,” she says as we leave the restaurant, pointing toward an anonymous gray car that looks like the floor model in an auto dealership specializing in anonymous gray cars. Her security detail suggests that it’s probably not a paparazzo because there’s no way a paparazzo could find us at such an unglamorous, unassuming establishment. But as with seemingly every other inference she has ever made, Taylor Swift is ultimately proven right. The guy in the gray car is taking her picture. This annoys her, but just barely.

It’s August in Southern California. We crawl into the back of a massive Toyota and start driving to Swift’s West Coast residence, located in a rural enclave of Beverly Hills. The gray car trails us through Franklin Canyon. Swift whips out her phone and starts showing me images from the video shoot for “Wildest Dreams,” including a clip of a giraffe licking her face. She has more photos on her phone than any person I’ve ever met. “I wanted this video to be about the making of a 1950s movie being filmed on location in Africa,” she explains. Swift came up with the concept after reading a book by Ava Gardner and Peter Evans, The Secret Conversations. Her premise for the video (co-starring Clint Eastwood’s son) is that—since social media did not exist in the ’50s—it would be impossible for actors not to fall in love if they were isolated together in Africa, since there would be no one else to talk to.

We chat a little about Ryan Adams and a little about books. Swift mentions that she wrote a non-autobiographical novel when she was 14, titled A Girl Named Girl, and that her parents still have it. I ask her what it was about, assuming she will laugh. But her memory of the plot is remarkably detailed. (It’s about a mother who wants a son but instead has a girl.) If she released it today, it would immediately be the best-selling YA novel in the nation. When she was about that same age, Swift’s family moved from Pennsylvania to Nashville, to jump-start her music career. I ask what she imagines might have happened if they’d never moved and if she’d never become an artist. “I would still be involved with music in my spare time,” she says. “But I would have gone to college, and I would probably be involved with a form of business where words and ideas are at the forefront. Such as marketing.” She returns to her phone and starts scrolling for an old voice memo she sent to Jack Antonoff of the band Bleachers while they were co-writing songs for 1989. Antonoff’s nickname for Swift is Dead Tooth, a reference to a minor dental mishap. Just as she tells me this, her cell phone rings. The display panel says the incoming call is from J TIMB. “Oh, my God. Justin Timberlake?” Her surprise does not seem artificial. “Can I take this?”

She takes the call. The volume on her phone is loud enough for me to intermittently hear both sides of the conversation. Swift explains that she’s driving to her house, but that she can’t actually stay there because contractors are renovating almost every room. “Have you ever seen the movie The Money Pit?” asks Timberlake. She has not, so Timberlake provides a capsule review. He has a 4-month-old baby at home and is constantly tired, yet he can’t fall sleep. He asks Swift for advice on sleeping. Swift tells the driver to pull over to the shoulder of the road, since she keeps losing reception as we drive through the canyon. The paparazzo in the gray car casually passes, having not-so-casually followed us for at least five miles.

The conversation lasts almost 15 minutes (which is a little weird, since I’m just sitting there beside her, openly taking notes). “You’re never going to get old,” Swift assures Timberlake. “That’s scientific fact. That’s medical.” Even her sarcasm is aspirational. Eventually JT tells her the reason he’s calling is because he wants to perform the song “Mirrors” with her on the last night of her upcoming five-date stand at Staples Center. (Late in every concert, Swift brings a surprise guest onstage.)
 She reacts to this news the way a teenage girl in Nebraska would react if suddenly informed that a paternity test had revealed Taylor Swift was her biological sister.

When she ends the call, Swift looks at me and says, “This is so crazy. This is so crazy.” She repeats that phrase four times, each time with ascending volume.

Now, inside my skull, I am thinking one thought: This is not remotely crazy. It actually seems like the opposite of crazy. Why wouldn’t Justin Timberlake want to perform with the biggest entertainer in America, to an audience of 15,000 people who will lose their collective mind the moment he appears? I’d have been much more surprised if he’d called to turn her down. But then I remember that Swift is 25 years old, and that her entire ethos is based on experiencing (and interpreting) how her insane life would feel if she were exactly like the type of person who’d buy a ticket to this particular concert. She has more perspective than I do. Every extension of who she is and how she works is (indeed) “so crazy,” and what’s even crazier is my inability to recognize just how crazy it is.

So Taylor Swift is right again.

If you don’t take Swift seriously, you don’t take contemporary music seriously. With the (arguable) exceptions of Kanye West and Beyoncé Knowles, she is the most significant pop artist of the modern age. The scale of her commercial supremacy defies parallel—she’s sold 1 million albums in a week three times, during an era when most major artists are thrilled to move 500,000 albums in a year. If a record as comparatively dominant as 1989 had actually existed in the year 1989, it would have surpassed the sales of Thriller. There is no demographic she does not tap into, which is obviously rare. But what’s even more atypical is how that ubiquity is critically received. Swift gets excellent reviews, particularly from the most significant arbiters of taste. (A 2011 New Yorker piece conceded that Swift’s reviews are “almost uniformly positive.”) She has never gratuitously sexualized her image and seems pathologically averse to controversy. There’s simply no antecedent for this kind of career: a cross-genre, youth-oriented, critically acclaimed colossus based entirely on the intuitive songwriting merits of a single female artist. It’s as if mid-period Garth Brooks was also early Liz Phair, minus the hat and the swearing. As a phenomenon, it’s absolutely new.

And this, somewhat predictably, creates a new set of problems.

Even within the most high-minded considerations of Swift’s music, there is inevitably some analysis (or speculation) about her personal life. She’s an utterly credible musician who is consumed as a tabloid personality. Very often (and not without justification), that binary is attributed to ingrained biases against female performers. But it’s more complicated than that. Swift writes about her life so directly that the listener is forced to think about her persona in order to fully appreciate what she’s doing creatively. This is her greatest power: an ability to combine her art and her life so profoundly that both spheres become more interesting to everyone, regardless of their emotional investment in either.

Swift clearly knows this is happening. But she can’t directly admit it, because it’s the kind of thing that only works when it seems accidental. She’s careful how she describes the process, because you don’t become who she is by describing things carelessly.

Even the most serious critics inevitably discuss the more tabloid aspects of your life. Is this valid? Does the fact that you write about yourself in such a confessional style require intelligent people to look at your music through that lens?

I don’t feel there is any injustice when people expand beyond my music and speculate on who certain songs might be about. I’ve never named names, so I feel like I still have a sense of power over what people say—even if that isn’t true, and even if I don’t have any power over what people say about me. The fact that I’ve never confirmed who those songs are about makes me feel like there is still one card I’m holding. So if you’re going to look at your life and say, “I get to play sold-out football stadiums all over the world. I get to call up my favorite artists and ask them to perform with me, and most of the time they say yes. I get to be on the cover of this magazine”—this is all because I write songs about my own life. So I would feel a little strange complaining about how it’s covered.
But I’m not asking if it’s fair or unfair, or if the downside is worth the upside. I’m asking from an aesthetic perspective: Is thinking about your real life an essential part of appreciating your music? Could your music be enjoyed the same way in a vacuum, even if no one knew anything else about you?

“Shake It Off” is one of my most successful songs, and that has nothing directly, intricately, pointedly personal in it. No one really says I stay out too late. I just thought it sounded good.

Have you ever stopped yourself from writing a fictional lyric because you feared it would be incorrectly applied to your nonfictional life?

No. Some of the things I write about on a song like “Blank Space” are satire. You take your creative license and create things that are larger than life. You can write things like I get drunk on jealousy but you’ll come back each time you leave, ’cause darling I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream. That is not my approach to relationships. But is it cool to write the narrative of a girl who’s crazy but seductive but glamorous but nuts but manipulative? That was the character I felt the media had written for me, and for a long time I felt hurt by it. I took it personally. But as time went by, I realized it was kind of hilarious.

It’s impossible for an artist to control how she is perceived. But an artist can anticipate those perceptions, which is almost as good. “A nuanced sense of humor does not translate on a general scale,” Swift says, “and I knew that going in. I knew some people would hear ‘Blank Space’ and say, See, we were right about her. And at that point, I just figure if you don’t get the joke, you don’t deserve to get the joke.”

There’s a long tradition of musicians expressing (or pretending to express) a degree of disinterest in how they are metabolized by the culture. They claim to ignore their own reviews while feigning a lack of discernment about what their audience wants or expects, since these are things that cannot be manipulated. Swift is not like this. She has an extrinsic focus that informs her creative process. From her perspective, not tracking how people view your work feels stranger than the alternative.

“I went through a few years where I just never went online and never looked at blogs,” she recalls. “This was around 2013, when the only thing anyone wanted to write about me was about me and some guy. It was really damaging. You’re thinking, ‘Everybody goes on dates when they’re 22. It’s fine, right?’ Nope. Not when you’re in this situation, and everything you do is blown out of proportion and expanded upon. And all of a sudden, there’s an overriding opinion that doesn’t accurately reflect how you actually live your life. So I didn’t go online for a year and a half. I actually forgot my Instagram password. But now I check in and see what’s happening. In 2015, that stuff does matter. Because if enough people say the same thing about me, it becomes fact in the general public’s mind. So I monitor what people say about me, and if I see a theme, I know what that means. I’ve had it happen twice before. In 2010, it was She’s too young to get all these awards. Look how annoying she is when she wins. Is she even good? And then in 2013, it was She just writes songs about guys to get revenge. She’s boy-crazy. She’s a problematic person. It will probably be something else again this year.”

How you view this level of consciousness is proportional to how you feel about Swift as a public figure. There is a perpetual sense that nothing about her career is accidental and that nothing about her life is unmediated. These are not unusual thoughts to have about young mainstream stars. But what’s different with Swift is her autonomy. There is no Svengali directing her career; there is no stage mother pushing her toward the spotlight. She is in total control of her own constructed reality. If there was a machine that built humans out of positive millennial stereotypes, Swift would be its utopian creation.

“I used to watch Behind the Music every day,” she says. (Her favorite episode was the one about the Bangles.) “When other kids were watching normal shows, I’d watch Behind the Music. And I would see these bands that were doing so well, and I’d wonder what went wrong. I thought about this a lot. And what I established in my brain was that a lack of self-awareness was always the downfall. That was always the catalyst for the loss of relevance and the loss of ambition and the loss of great art. So self-awareness has been such a huge part of what I try to achieve on a daily basis. It’s less about reputation management and strategy and vanity than it is about trying to desperately preserve self-awareness, since that seems to be the first thing to go out the door when people find success.”

The advantage of this self-focused fixation is clear. Swift is allowed to make whatever record she wants, based on the reasonable argument that she understands her specific space in the culture more deeply than anyone around her. The making of 1989 is a prime example: She claims everyone at her label (the Nashville-based Big Machine) tried to persuade her not to make a straightforward pop album. She recounts a litany of arguments with various label executives over every possible detail, from how much of her face would appear on the cover to how co-writer Max Martin would be credited in the liner notes.

As far as I can tell, Swift won every one of these debates.

“Even calling this record 1989 was a risk,” she says. “I had so many intense conversations where my label really tried to step in. I could tell they’d all gotten together and decided, ‘We gotta talk some sense into her. She’s had an established, astronomically successful career in country music. To shake that up would be the biggest mistake she ever makes.’ But to me, the safest thing I could do was take the biggest risk. I know how to write a song. I’m not confident about a lot of other aspects of my life, but I know how to write a song. I’d read a review of [2012’s] Red that said it wasn’t sonically cohesive. So that was what I wanted on 1989: an umbrella that would go over all of these songs, so that they all belonged on the same album. But then I’d go into the label office, and they were like, ‘Can we talk about putting a fiddle and a steel-guitar solo on ‘Shake It Off’ to service country radio?’ I was trying to make the most honest record I could possibly make, and they were kind of asking me to be a little disingenuous about it: ‘Let’s capitalize on both markets.’ No, let’s not. Let’s choose a lane.”

Like almost all famous people, Swift has two ways of speaking. The first is the way she talks when she’s actively shaping the interview—optimistic, animated, and seemingly rehearsed (even when that’s impossible). The second is the way she talks when she cares less about the way the words are presented and more about the message itself (chin slightly down, brow slightly furrowed, timbre slightly deeper). The first way is how she talks when she’s on television; the second is unequivocal and less animatronic. But she oscillates between the two styles fluidly, because either (a) this dissonance is less intentional than it appears or (b) she can tell I’m considerably more interested in anything delivered in the second style.

ate in our lunch, I mention something that happened several years ago: By chance, I’d found myself having dinner with a former acquaintance of Swift’s who offhandedly described her as “calculating.” This is the only moment during our interview when Swift appears remotely flustered. She really, really hates the word calculating. She despises how it has become tethered to her iconography and believes the person I met has been the singular voice regurgitating this categorization. As she explains these things, her speech does not oscillate from the second mode.

“Am I shooting from the hip?” she asks rhetorically. “Would any of this have happened if I was? In that sense, I do think about things before they happen. But here was someone taking a positive thing—the fact that I think about things and that I care about my work—and trying to make that into an insinuation about my personal life. Highly offensive. You can be accidentally successful for three or four years. Accidents happen. But careers take hard work.”
Here we see Swift’s circuitous dilemma: Any attempt to appear less calculating scans as even more calculated. Because Swift’s professional career has unspooled with such precision, it’s assumed that her social life is no less premeditated. This even applies to casual, non-romantic relationships. Over the past three years, Swift has built a volunteer army of high-profile friends, many of whom appear in her videos and serve as special guests at her concerts. In almost any other circumstance, this would be seen as a likable trait; Leonardo DiCaprio behaved similarly in the ’90s, and everyone thought it was awesome. But it’s somehow different when the hub of the wheel is Swift. People get skeptical. Her famous friends are marginalized as acquisitions, selected to occupy specific roles, almost like members of the Justice League (“the ectomorph model,” “the inventive indie artist,” “the informed third-wave feminist,” etc.). Such perceptions perplex Swift, who is genuinely obsessed with these attachments. “I honestly think my lack of female friendships in high school and middle school is why my female friendships are so important now,” she says. “Because I always wanted them. It was just hard for me to have friends.”

Popular people often claim they were once unpopular, so I ask Swift for a specific example. She tells a story about middle school, when she called several of her peers on the phone and asked if they wanted to go shopping. Every girl had a different excuse for why she couldn’t go. Eventually, Swift’s mother agreed to take her to the local mall. When they arrived, Swift saw all of the girls she had called on the phone, goofing around in Victoria’s Secret. “I just remember my mom looking at me and saying, We’re going to King of Prussia Mall. Which is the big, big mall in Pennsylvania, 45 minutes away. So we left and went to the better mall. My mom let me escape from certain things that were too painful to deal with. And we talked about it the whole ride there, and we had a good time shopping.”

This incident appears to be the genesis for a verse in her 2008 song “The Best Day,” a connection she doesn’t note when she tells me the story. A cynical person could read something into this anecdote and turn it into a metaphor about capitalism or parenting or creativity or Pennsylvania. But in the framework of our conversation, it did not seem metaphoric of anything. It just seemed like a (very real) memory that might be more internally motivating than any simplistic desire for money or power.


So is it unfair to categorize Swift as calculating? Maybe, and particularly if you view that term as exclusively pejorative. But calling her guileless would be even crazier. Swift views her lyrics as the most important part of her art (“The lyrics are what I want you to focus on,” she asserts), so we spend some time parsing specific passages from specific songs. Here is how she dissects the conjecture over “Bad Blood,” a single universally assumed to be about Katy Perry.


You never say who your songs are about, but you concede that if enough people believe something, it essentially becomes fact. So by not saying who you’re writing about, aren’t you allowing public consensus to dictate the meaning of your work? If everyone assumes that “Bad Blood” is about a specific person, aren’t you allowing the culture to create a fact about your life?

You’re in a Rolling Stone interview, and the writer says, “Who is that song about? That sounds like a really intense moment from your life.” And you sit there, and you know you’re on good terms with your ex-boyfriend, and you don’t want him—or his family—to think you’re firing shots at him. So you say, “That was about losing a friend.” And that’s basically all you say. But then people cryptically tweet about what you meant.
 I never said anything that would point a finger in the specific direction of one specific person, and I can sleep at night knowing that. I knew the song would be assigned to a person, and the easiest mark was someone who I didn’t want to be labeled with this song. It was not a song about heartbreak. It was about the loss of friendship.

But nobody thinks that song is about a guy.

But they would have. So I don’t necessarily care who people think it’s about. I just needed to divert them away from the easiest target. Listen to the song. It doesn’t point to any one person or any one situation. But if you’d listened to my previous four albums, you would think this was about a guy who broke my heart. And nothing could be further from the truth. It was important to show that losing friendships can be just as damaging to a person as losing a romantic relationship.

Now, there are more than a few molecules of bullshit in this response. When Swift says, “And that’s basically all you say,” she’s neglecting to mention that she also told the reporter that the disharmony stemmed from a business conflict, and that the individual in question tried to sabotage an arena tour by hiring away some of her employees. These details dramatically reduce the pool of potential candidates. Yet consider the strategy’s larger brilliance: In order to abort the possibility of a rumor she did not want, she propagated the existence of a different rumor that offered the added value of making the song more interesting.


Swift can manufacture the kind of mythology that used to happen to Carly Simon by accident.

Speaking of accidents, here’s some breaking news: They happen to Taylor Swift, too. She believes the most consequential accident of her professional life was when Kanye West famously stormed the stage during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards. I’m surprised when she brings this up unprompted, because she has barely addressed the incident in five years, aside from the (comically undisguised) song “Innocent.” But fences have been mended and feelings have been felt. At this summer’s VMAs, Swift warmly presented West with the Video Vanguard trophy. She’ll probably serve as Secretary of the Interior when he becomes president.

Swift was lauded for handling West’s ’09 intrusion with grace and composure, but her personal memories of the event dwell on the bewilderment. When West first jumped onstage, Swift halfway assumed he was about to make a special presentation, honoring her for being the first country artist to ever win a VMA. She truly had no idea what was transpiring. “When the crowd started booing, I thought they were booing because they also believed I didn’t deserve the award. That’s where the hurt came from.
 I went backstage and cried, and then I had to stop crying and perform five minutes later. I just told myself I had to perform, and I tried to convince myself that maybe this wasn’t that big of a deal.
 But that was the most happenstance thing to ever happen in my career. And to now be in a place where Kanye and I respect each other—that’s one of my favorite things that has happened in my career.”

Swift analyzes her friendships so often that I eventually ask what seems like an obvious question: Does she ever feel lonely? She responds by literally talking about Friends. “I’m around people so much,” she says. “Massive amounts of people. I do a meet-and-greet every night on the tour, and it’s 150 people. Before that, it’s a radio meet-and-greet with 40 people. After the show, it’s 30 or 40 more people. So then when I go home and turn on the TV, and I’ve got Monica and Chandler and Ross and Rachel and Phoebe and Joey on a Friends marathon, I don’t feel lonely. I’ve just been onstage for two hours, talking to 60,000 people about my feelings. That’s so much social stimulation. When I get home, there is not one part of me that wishes I was around other people.”

This is understandable. Still, I note something any musician obsessed with self-awareness would undoubtedly recognize: In the retrospective context of a hypothetical Behind the Music episode, this anecdote would be framed as depressing. It would paint the portrait of a super-famous entertainer spending her day emoting to thousands of strangers, only to return home to an empty house and the one-way company of two-dimensional characters.

Does she not see the irony?
Oh, she sees it. But that doesn’t mean it’s real.

“There is such a thing as having enough,” she says in her non-TV voice. “You might think a meet-and-greet with 150 people sounds sad, because maybe you think I’m forced to do it. But you would be surprised. A meaningful conversation doesn’t mean that conversation has to last an hour. A meet-and-greet might sound weird to someone who’s never done one, but after ten years, you learn to appreciate happiness when it happens, and that happiness is rare and fleeting, and that you’re not entitled to it. You know, during the first few years of your career, the only thing anyone says to you is ‘Enjoy this. Just enjoy this.’ That’s all they ever tell you. And I finally know how to do that.”

Taylor Swift is 25. But she’s older than you."

Mine Lyrics
Oh oh yeeah

You were in college working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of fallin’
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say ""Can you believe it?
As we’re lying on the couch?""
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I can see it now

Do you remember, we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine, yeah

Flash forward and we’re taking on the world together
And there’s a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I’m guarded
You say we’ll never make my parents’ mistakes

Oh but we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yeah, yeah, this is what I thought about


Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man’s careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine, yeah

Oh I
And I remember that fight
Two-thirty AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the ""Goodbye""
‘Cause that’s all I’ve ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I’ll never leave you alone""

You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it’s like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter
You're the best thing that’s ever been mine""
(Hold on make it last, hold on never turn back)
I fell in love with a careless man’s careful daughter
You're the best thing that’s ever been mine"""

Folklore Medley: Exile / Cardigan / August / My Tears Ricochet Lyrics
[My Tears Ricochet]
We gather here, we line up
Weeping in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire
You'll be made of ashes too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
Till my dying day

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed, look at how my tears ricochet

[Exile]
I can see you staring, honey
Like he's just your understudy
Likе you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Sеcond, third, and hundredth chances
Balancing on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown
Now I'm in exile, seeing you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door


Just step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (you never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)

[August]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away
Like a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away
Like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Cardigan]
But I knew you
Leaving like a father
Running like water, oh oh oh
When you are young
They assume you know nothing


But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasing shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standing in my front porch light

I knew you'd come back to me
I knew you'd come back to me"

Teardrops On My Guitar (International Mix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


[Pre-Chorus]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile, so he won't see"

Mine / Delicate Lyrics
[Lauren]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse
So, he must like me for me

[Katherine]
I'm here on the east side
Where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here you can meet me in the back

[Lauren]
'Cause I like you

[Dani]
Dark jeans in your Nikes, look at you
Oh dang, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

[Lauren]
'Cause I like you

[Lisa]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse
You must like me for me


[Lauren]
Yeah, I want you

[Lisa]
We can't make any promises
Now, can we, babe
But you can me think

[Amy]
I'm so, I'm so happy you're alive
Swear that I'm down if you're down
I'll be right there by your side
Boy, anything that I can do just to keep you in my life, oh
I just had to let you know you're

[Lauren]
Fine
Runnin' circles 'round my mind
Even when it's rainy, all you ever do is shine
You're a fire, you're a star just like Mariah
Man, this feel incredible
It's never been so right
You're

[Dani]
Mine
Nobody better, I don't wanna waste no time
Feels like forever, even if forever's tonight
Just stay with me
Waste this night away with me you're mine
I can't look away, I just gotta say


[Katherine]
Sometimes, I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?

[Amy]
Sometimes, when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine all of the time

[Christina]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it true that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate

[Lisa]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause you know that I'm delicate

Should’ve Said No (International Mix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?


[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no


[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me"

TIME 100: Taylor Swift (2019) Lyrics
I’ve been a Taylor Swift fan for as long as I can remember. But it wasn’t until I met and got to know her that I understood how wonderful a person she truly is.

Taylor makes the job of creating music for millions of people look easy. It all comes from her—her belief in magic and love, and her ability to be as honest and raw as possible. She’s the master of putting the perfect amount of thought into not overthinking, and that’s why her music connects so well.

I was so lucky to be able to open for a handful of her stadium shows on the 1989 World Tour.
 And I quickly learned that the magic of Taylor Swift doesn’t come from the lights, dancers or fireworks (although all of that is incredible) but from the electrifying connection that she has with the people who are there to see her. There’s an overwhelming feeling in the air. The feeling of your heart racing in your chest with ­excitement—so much so that by the time you get to “Love Story,” all you want to do is pick up your phone and text every person you know to say how much you love them.
 The feeling is so thick, you feel like you could reach out and grab it to keep forever.

Taylor makes anyone older feel young again and anyone young feel they can do anything. It’s so rare and so special. If there is one thing I want to achieve in my career and life, it’s that."

End Game Lyrics
[Chorus: Lauren]
I wanna be your end game
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Post-Chorus: Lisa]
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me, we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh, you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too

[Verse 1: Dani]
You so dope, don't lt me go
I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most, I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat, boat
I got a reputation, girl that don't precede me (-cede me)
I'm one call away whenever you need me (Need me)
I'm in a G5 (Five), come to the A-Side (Side)
I got a good girl persona, that's what they like (That's what they like)
You love it, I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down, and I protect you with my life


[Pre-Chorus: Lisa]
I don't wanna hurt you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Chillin' on a beach with you right next to me
I know what they all say
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Katherine]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 2: Lauren & Dani]
Knew her when I was young, reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors, I'm knee-deep
The truth is, it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we'd not do it for long
And you understand the good and bad end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes and made some choices, that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the 4th of July
I've passed days without fun, this end game is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say it


[Pre-Chorus: Lisa]
I don't wanna touch you, I don't wanna be
Just another ex-love you don't wanna see
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you, I just wanna be
Chillin' on a beach with you right next to me
I know what they all say
But I ain't tryna play

[Chorus: Amy]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game

[Verse 3: Christina]
I hit you like bang, we tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets, but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand print's on my soul
It's like your eyes are glitter, it's like your smile is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips


[Chorus: Katherine]
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (Me and you, first string)
I wanna be your A-Team ( A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game
I wanna be your end game (End game)
I wanna be your first string (First string)
I wanna be your A-Team (A-Team)
I wanna be your end game, end game"

Change (Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through

[Chorus]
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh

[Verse 2]
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, finding things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this

[Chorus]
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh


[Bridge]
Tonight we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight

[Chorus]
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
Hallelujah"

Lavender Haze (Mixed) Lyrics
[Intro]
Meet me at midnight

[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia

[Pre-Chorus]
I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

[Verse 2]
All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
Thе only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wifе


[Pre-Chorus]
I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender—"

​clean (emlyn’s version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2]
There was nothin' left to do (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
When the butterflies turned to dust that covеred my whole room
So I punched a holе in the roof (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud, but no one heard a thing


[Chorus]
Rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

[Break]
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst (Ah)

[Chorus]
Rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean


[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I think I am finally clean

The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah

Rare Peer (Brenda Lee Tribute),https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-rare-peer-brenda-lee-tribute-annotated,"1 Contributor
Rare Peer (Brenda Lee Tribute) Lyrics
“Rare Peer” is an essay about singer Brenda Lee that Taylor wrote when she was eighteen. It was later featured in the 2017 book Woman Walk The Line, a collection of writings about female country stars.
I'm curled up in my mother's bed, staring intently at my laptop. I'm watching a video of a familiar-looking man wearing a black tuxedo. The video seems to be of a televised award show. The tape is grainy, but the man steps up to the mic and his words are clear:

""Now I'm gonna deal you a queen from the winning hand. Her voice is full like solid gold, with some platinum blended in. Sometimes you'll hear silver when she twists and twirls her notes... but gold is Brenda's metal in this song I wish I'd wrote. Ladies and gentlemen... Brenda Lee.""

The camera then focuses on a woman in her late thirties. The music starts, and she's looking down at a framed picture. She's at ease. She is theatrical. And she is beautiful, in a sparkling gown that matches the twinkle in her eye. Lights, camera, action. She starts to sing. That's when you hear the gold, and you watch her as she holds the crowd in the palm of her hand. The performance ends, and the crowd goes wild. The lovely lady graciously takes a bow. She smiles out into the vast darkness, taking it all in with grace and composure. The video ends, and I reflect back on what I just saw. It was a timeless performance, but here are the facts: The year is 1983. The song is ""Someone Loves You Honey."" The man in the tuxedo is Johnny Cash. And the woman in the beautiful dress with the honey-like voice is none other than Brenda Lee.

Brenda Lee, who was born in 1944 near Atlanta and used her prodigious singing talent to support her family after the tragic death of her father. Brenda Lee, the little girl who took over the music world with chart-topping hits when she was still a child. Brenda Lee, the woman who ushered in a new style of rock & roll and was one of the early musical artists to find her fame through television. Brenda Lee, the artist who later went back to her country roots, proving that she could create classics and break down barriers no matter what genre or category her music fell under. Brenda Lee, the singer who mastered the sound of heartbreak so flawlessly that she made audiences not only identify with her but believe her.

I watch the look on her face as she ends her song and first hears that applause. There's a reason she's been able to move people to their feet for almost sixty years. Brenda Lee is grace. Brenda Lee is class and composure. And when she hears the roar of a crowd, Brenda Lee smiles like she's five years old and receiving her first standing ovation. Brenda Lee is someone I will always look up to because of the way she shines. As Johnny Cash said in 1983, it's almost like she's golden."

Taylor Swift Interviews Rock ’n’ Roll Icon Pattie Boyd on Songwriting, Beatlemania, & the Power of Being a Muse Lyrics
In the 1960s and ’70s, Pattie Boyd stood at the intersection of fashion, rock ’n’ roll, art, and fame. Widely considered one of the greatest muses of all time, Boyd, who was married first to George Harrison and later to Eric Clapton, inspired the hits “Something” by the Beatles, and “Layla” and “Wonderful Tonight” by Clapton. Recently I devoured this intriguing woman’s memoir, Wonderful Tonight. A few weeks later, I had the pleasure of sitting down with her in the kitchen of her beautiful Kensington flat. As the sunlight poured through the windows, her blue eyes lit up as she spoke. There is a playful quality about her and, surprisingly—considering how much she has experienced in her life—a lightness.

TAYLOR SWIFT: I have been so excited to talk to you because we’re both women whose lives have been deeply influenced by songs and songwriting. I stand on one side of it, and you on the other. Does the concept of being called a muse feel like a correct fit?

PATTIE BOYD: I find the concept of being a muse understandable when you think of all the great painters, poets, and photographers who usually have had one or two. The artist absorbs an element from their muse that has nothing to do with words, just the purity of their essence.

TS: What do you feel might be a factor that artists want to communicate with you through song?

PB: I think in my case both George and Eric had an inability to communicate their feelings through normal conversation. I became a reflection for them.

TS: I wondered who and what situation “Wonderful Tonight” was written about, and now I know it’s about you getting ready for a party, changing clothes, and saying, “I don’t like this, I don’t like that.”

PB: I came downstairs with trepidation thinking [Eric] was going to be so angry that I’d taken far too long, and instead he said, “Listen, I’ve just written this song.”

TS: That is so incredible to me.

PB: But you must do that too. You must be inspired by a few moments or something, the way your boyfriend turns or says something to you or a little bit of a smile or “Is he thinking this or that?,” and that would inspire you. Can you write it the moment it’s happening?

TS: There are definitely moments when it’s like this cloud of an idea comes and just lands in front of your face, and you reach up and grab it. A lot of songwriting is things you learn, structure, and cultivating that skill, and knowing how to craft a song. But there are mystical, magical moments, inexplicable moments when an idea that is fully formed just pops into your head. And that’s the purest part of my job. It can get complicated on every other level, but the songwriting is still the same uncomplicated process it was when I was 12 years old writing songs in my room.

PB: Right, right…

TS: I don’t know what it is that makes some people really creatively inspiring. There have been people I’ve spent a lot of time with who I just couldn’t write about.

PB: Yes, now what is that?


TS: I don’t know. It’s just that some people come into your life and they have this effect on you. It’s really interesting because in your case you inspired that creative output from two iconic musicians. That just blows my mind. It’s very rare!

PB: Well, the more you say it to me, the more it’s blowing my mind.

TS: You met George Harrison at 19 on the set of A Hard Day’s Night. All of a sudden your life was changed forever because you fell in love with someone who the world was obsessed with. There was no band as big as the Beatles. Did anyone prepare you for the attention?

PB: No. Nobody took on that role. Nobody thought that role would be significant for a start. I remember a journalist coming to our house one day and saying to George, “In all seriousness, when do you think the bubble is going to burst? When are the Beatles going to be finished?”

TS: Wow.

PB: If they thought that, there’s no reason anyone would think, “Ah, I’ll look after Pattie and guide her through what is going to be a tremendously difficult situation for a young girl to cope with.” The only thing Brian Epstein, their manager, told me and the other wives and girlfriends was, “Don’t talk to the press.”

TS: Were the fans the reason you decided to live in the country?

PB: Living in London with George, there were so many fans every day, it became impossible to leave the flat. Brian Epstein thought there might be an idea that John, Ringo, and George move to the country, have little houses about an hour out of London. We would decorate the outside of our house with spray-paint cans. The whole house was like a psychedelic monster.

TS: I remember seeing a picture of the house, and Mick Jagger and Marianne Faithfull had spray-painted their names on the wall with the words mick and marianne were here. I read a book about Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor recently, and how there was this crazy frenzy surrounding them. In the book, Elizabeth is quoted as saying, “It could be worse, we could be the Beatles.”
 You are one of the only people who can say they experienced what Beatlemania was like from the inside. How did that feel for you?

PB: In my first experience, I found it absolutely terrifying. I got to see the Beatles play at a theater in London, and George told me that I should leave with my friends before the last number. So before the last song, we got up from our seats and walked toward the nearest exit door, and there were these girls behind me. They followed us out, and they were kicking me and pulling my hair and pushing us all the way down this long passageway.

TS: What were they saying?

PB: “We hate you.”

TS: That is my worst nightmare. You probably felt like, “If you knew me and I knew you, you would not be pulling my hair in an alleyway and saying, ‘I hate you.’”


PB: Exactly.

TS: Has the dynamic changed with Beatles fans now that you put on these incredible exhibitions of your photographs?

PB: George is no longer with us, or John. It was such a long time ago, and the fans haven’t held on to the same antagonistic feelings toward me. Actually they seem happy that I’m sharing the photographs I took. One time I was having an exhibition, and these girls turned up dressed like me in A Hard Day’s Night.

TS: It’s so cute when people do that. I love that.


PB: It is adorable.

TS: That is amazing that you could go from a place of feeling incredibly frightened by the idea of this attention from people who loved the Beatles, and now there is just a huge amount of gratitude from them. For me, one of the most heartbreaking moments in the book is when, years later, you and Eric get married, and George and his new wife, Olivia, come to the wedding party, Paul comes, Ringo comes, but John couldn’t go. He said later that he would have loved to come. That night there was a huge jam session, and had he been there it would have been the last time the Beatles played together.

PB: Can you imagine? I was heartbroken.

TS: My heart was pierced by that.

PB: John felt he couldn’t come because he thought if he left America they wouldn’t let him back in, and it was important for him to be in America.

TS: I found it staggeringly beautiful in the book how you had been through many ups and downs, and told these stunning truths about your relationships, but everyone seems to be on really good terms. I mean, Eric even gave you permission to publish his love letters. What did it take for you to arrive at such a place of goodwill with people you’ve been through so much with? Is that just time passing?

PB: I think time must play a big part. Because it all broke up for whatever reason, there is no need to carry on some sort of hate or dislike for this person. And then with time I thought, “I’ll just call on Eric and see if he’ll let me use these wonderful letters that he wrote, and if he needs anything from me, he just needs to call me, same thing, and I would say ‘yes’ to him.” I think this is all based on my memories of how it was when we were first married and what fun we had, the love that we’d enjoyed together as well.

TS: It sounds like you take ownership of the past, and not just the good parts.

PB: I do. Absolutely.


TS: Lastly, what advice would you give a 28-year-old who’s deeply inspired by your outlook? I would love to look back on my life with the same clarity, wisdom, and peace that you seem to have.

PB: You have to remember that nothing remains the same. It’s always going to change. The whole world keeps changing, we keep changing, things in our lives keep changing. Nothing remains the same. If you’re happy or you’re sad, it’s not going to last forever. You just have to keep remembering that."

Juxtaposition Lyrics
When it’s good, it’s good
When it’s bad, it’s like a living nightmare
Fair enough, you’ve had many before
The ones who treated you badly
Lately, I’ve been thinking though
If you’ve been hurt
Why did you hurt me as well?
If you know that feeling
But I’m the one who needs healing?

Jekyll and Hyde
Hide your emotions
When you want to love me
You’re next to me by my side
But when you don’t feel like it
You are nowhere to be found
It’s rare
It’s funny
The juxtaposition
Drink in your hand
Mine on your waistline
Until it wears off
You and your gamе plan
Will you be around mine or hers tomorrow night
It’s cruеl
It’s love?
The juxtaposition


Did I ever get to meet the real you?
Your body was next to me
But your heart nowhere to be found
Blamed me for all of your untreated problems
Screaming, crying on your bedroom floor
Then you kissed me
Used it like a bandage
But you can’t bandage a bullet wound

Jekyll and Hyde
Hide my emotions
When you want to love me
You’re next to me by my side
But when you don’t feel like it
You are nowhere to be found
It’s rare
It’s funny
The juxtaposition
Drink in your hand
Mine on your waistline
Until it wears off
You and your game plan
Will you be around mine or hers tomorrow night
It’s cruel
It’s love?
The juxtaposition


You fall in love madly
The crying into kissing
The loving into fighting
The hurting into feelings
Then you feel like the fool, you let him in again ‘cause of the good days, good dates, good nights
You start to only remember the good parts
Not the screaming, fighting, crying and your soul dying
He sold you a fantasy, my bedroom walls tells a different story
Then he says no more
But they still put out their hand
And say let’s go

The juxtaposition
Hide my emotions
When you want to love me
You’re next to me by my side
But when you don’t feel like it
You are nowhere to be found
It’s rare
It’s funny
The juxtaposition
Drink in your hand
Mine on your waistline
Until it wears off
You and your game plan
Will you be around mine or hers tomorrow night
It’s cruel
It’s all on you?
The juxtaposition"

Love Story Lyrics
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to meet 'ya
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said


Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we will make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say

I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
Then I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said

""Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your daddy, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


Say ""Yes""
Because we were both young when I first saw you
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes"""

Lover Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there’s a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I’ve loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover


[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you’re my, my, my, my
Darling, you’re my, my, my, my lover"

Daylight Lyrics
My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
Everyone looked worse in the light
There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
I'll tell you truth, but never goodbye

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a 20 year dark night
And now I see daylight, I only see daylight

Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke
Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a 20 year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight

I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight


And I can still see it all (in my mind)
All of you, all of me (intertwined)
I once believed love would be (black and white)
But it's golden (golden)

And I can still see it all (in my head)
Back and forth from New York (sneakin' in your bed)
I once believed love would be (burnin' red)
But it's golden
Like daylight
Like daylight
Like daylight
Daylight

I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
I've been sleepin' so long in a 20 year dark night
And now I see daylight
I only see daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight
I only see daylight, daylight, daylight, daylight

Like daylight
It's golden
Like daylight
You gotta step into the daylight and let it go
Just let it go
Let it go"

The Tortured Poets Department / Marron Lyrics
[Part I: The Tortured Poets Department]

[Verse]
You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the Tortured Poets Department
I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?

[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we'rе modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
No-fucking-body
Nobody

[Part ll: Marron]


[Verse]
Whеn the morning came we were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end up on the floor anyway?"" You say
""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how""
I see you every day now

[Chorus]
And I chose you
The one I was dancin' with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my T-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark you saw on my collarbone, the rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home, so scarlet, it was maroon

[Post-Chorus]
Marron

[Part III: The Tortured Poets Department]

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding


[Part IV: Marron]

[Bridge]
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave

[Spoken]
Ok, I wanna do this one more time on this tour
One last time we get to sing this together

[Chorus]
The burgundy on my T-shirt when you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks, so scarlet, it was
The mark you saw on my collarbone, the rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home, so scarlet, it was maroon"

Mine (Commentary) Lyrics
[Becca Walls, 2018]
This is Big Machine Radio, hey there I'm Becca and you know, it was the fall of 2010 when Taylor Swift released her first studio album, ""Speak Now"", which means it's celebrating its eigth anniversary this year, so we thought we would take a look back at this album
I would say that this was probably Taylor Swift's final full-fledged country album, because her next album ""Red"" we started to feel a little bit of those pop inclinations in some of her songs, but we're gonna take a look back, I had a chance to talk to Taylor back in 2010 when she released this album and we talked about every single song, what it meant to her, what inspired the songs, and we're gonna play the entire album as well, as we hear from Taylor

The first song on this album is ""Mine""

[Taylor Swift, 2010]
The first single of the record is called ""Mine"", and it's a song that is about, kind of, my tendency to run from love, it's been sort of, a recent tendency and I think it's because for me every really direct example of love that I've had in front of me has ended in goodbye and has ended in breakups and things like that, and so I think I've developed this pattern of running away when it comes time to fall in love and to stay in a relationship, and this song is sort of about finding the exception to that and finding someone who would make you believe in love and realise that it can work out

[Becca Walls, 2018]
And you know it's interesting, 8 years later we can see that Taylor Swift has found that person that has made her believe in love with Joe Alwyn, and I'm so happy for her. But this was the first single she released off her album, ""Speak Now"", this is ""Mine"", on Big Machine Radio"

I Knew You Were Trouble Lyrics
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me
You found me
You found me

I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me
Without me
Without me

And he's long gone, when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been

Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble
Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble


No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowning

And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see
Now I see
Now I see

He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been

Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble
Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble


And the saddest fear, comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything, yeah!

Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Till you put me down, oh

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been

Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble
Oh, Oh
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble...

I knew you were trouble when you walked in...
Trouble, Trouble, Trouble...

I knew you were trouble when you walked in...

Bejeweled (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight

[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

[Post-Chorus]
Nice

[Verse 2]
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)


[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

[Post-Chorus]
Nice

[Bridge]
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine


[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice

[Outro]
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer"

Midnight Rain Lyrics
[Intro]
Rain
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight

[Verse 2]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens
And big pretenders
But for some it was paradise, oh
My boy was a montage
A slow motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart
'Cause he was nice
He was sunshine
I was midnight rain

[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wantеd a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
Hе stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight


[Verse 2]
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him it's every day, oh
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine
I was midnight rain

[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight
He wanted it comfortable
I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride
I was making my own name
Chasing that fame
He stayed the same
All of me changed
Like midnight


[Outro]
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted
Just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted
Some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
Midnights like this"

Never Grow Up Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favorite nightlight
To you, everything is funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred
And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up

[Verse 2]
You're in the car on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom is dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots
But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember she's getting older, too
Don't lose the way that you dance
Around in your PJs getting ready for school


[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
I won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

[Post-Chorus]
Don't you ever grow up

[Bridge]
Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
And memorize what it sounded like whenever I'd get home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all of your brother's favorite songs
Oh, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, don't you ever grow up

[Chorus]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
Won't let nobody hurt you
I won't let no one break your heart
And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up

Don't you ever grow up"

Smokey Black Nights (Acoustic) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Let's watch the tide chase the waves onto the sand
I wonder if a broken heart can feel the warmth of my hand
And I wonder what a piece of driftwood has seen all through his lifetime
Let's walk away the past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 1]
I've seen a million things
Spoke a million words
Now I only want to speak to you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Verse 2]
Still through the haze I can make out constellations
I'll make one of you and me as we sit in the sand
And I saw that sunset gleaming as my еyes went wild
Let's walk away thе past through the smokey black nights

[Chorus 2]
I've played a thousand songs
Sang a thousand words
Now I only want to sing to you
Waited on a wire
Staring at the fire
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights


[Chorus 3]
I've walked a thousand miles
Smiled a thousand smiles
Now I only smile when I'm with you
Waiting for the words
Counting every bird
There's nothing I'd rather do
On the smokey black nights

[Outro]
So walk with me as the sweet wind dances
I'll write a song for you and me on the smokey black nights"

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me think

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
'Cause I want you
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Boy I never seen that color blue
Think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me think


[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn’t it?
It’s delicate

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home get you like I do? (Like I do)
Long drives, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me (You must like me for me)
'Cause I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me think


[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me)

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the time
All the time

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Isn't it? Isn't it?)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
(Isn't it? Isn't it?)
Sometimes when I look into you’re eyes
I pretend you’re mine
'Cause I know that it’s delicate"

Two Is Better Than One Lyrics
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought hey
You know this could be somethin'
Cos' everything you do in words you say
You know it always takes my breath away
Now I'm left with nothin'
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
There's so much time
To figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes
And make it hard for breathing
Cos' when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing
That maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
There's so much time
To figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought hey
Maybe its true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
There's so much time
To figure out the rest of my life
But I figured out with all that's said and done
I'm thinking two is better than one
Two is better than one"

All Too Well (Ten Minute Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

[Verse 2]
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

[Verse 3]
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me
And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now
He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was
'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame


[Pre-Chorus]
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah

[Bridge]
Well, maybe we got lost in translation, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all


[Verse 4]
They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell
Every time you double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die
The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened, you
That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come
And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""

[Verse 5]
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well


[Verse 6]
And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight
And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

[Outro]
Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it"

Love Story (Matt’s Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1 - Matt Cutshall]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus - Matt Cutshall]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,""

[Chorus - Aaron Gillepsie]
And I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2 - Matt Cutshall]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus - Matt Cutshall]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,""

[Chorus - Aaron Gillepsie]
And I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus - Aaron Gillepsie]
Oh, oh
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Bridge - Matt Cutshall]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town


[Chorus 2 - Matt Cutshall, Aaron Gillepsie]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

[Outro - Aaron Gillepsie]
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'"""

Lover (Official Music Video) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover


[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Lover"

WE ARE NEVER EVER GETTING BACK TOGETHER Lyrics
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together
Like, ever

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me) But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""

(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together


We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Getting back together (Yeah)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me) But we are never, ever, ever"

Wildest Dreams / Blue Jeans Lyrics
[Verse 1: Amy]
He said let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city
Away from the crowd
I thought nothing can help me now
Nothing lasts forever
This is gonna take me down

[Verse 2: Christina]
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
You fit me better than my favorite sweater, and I know
That love is mean, and love hurts
I still remember that day we met in
December

[Chorus: Lauren]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your

[Post-Chorus: Lauren, Christina]
Wildest dreams
Ah-aah, haa (Say you’ll remember, say you’ll remember)
Wildest dreams
Ah-aah, haa (Say you’ll remember, say you’ll remember)


[Verse 3: Christina]
He said, ""No one else knows me like you""
And I can't help but fall, there's nothing I can do
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now

[Verse 4: Dani]
But he home out on Sunday, said he'd come on Monday
I stayed up waitin', anticipatin' and pacin' but he was
Chasing paper
Caught up in the game, it was the last I heard

[Chorus: Katherine, Christina]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe (Say you’ll remember, say you’ll remember)
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your (Say you’ll remember, say you’ll remember)

[Post-Chorus: Katherine]
Wildest dreams
Ah-aah, haa
Wildest dreams
Ah-aah, haa

[Bridge: Lisa, Amy, Katherine]
You'll see me in hindsight, thinkin' 'bout you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday when you leave me, I'd bet these memories
Follow you around


You'll see me in hindsight, thinking about you all night
Burnin’ it down

Someday when you leave me, I'll bet these memories
Follow you around
(Follow you around)

[Breakdown: Dani]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, staring at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again even if it's just pretend

[Chorus: Lisa, Lauren, Lisa and Lauren]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress, looking at the sunset babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks (Oh)
Say you'll see me again even if it's just in your

[Outro: Lauren, Lisa]
I will love you 'till the end of time (Wildest dreams)
I would wait a million years (Ah-aah, haa)
Promise you'll remember that you're mine (Wildest dreams)
Baby can you see through the tears? (Ah-aah, haa)
I love you more than ever before (Wildest dreams)
Say you’ll remember, say you’ll remember, oh baby, ooh (Ah-aah, haa)
I will love you 'till the end of time (Wildest dreams)

The City/Style Lyrics
[Verse 1: Mikael Olsson & Haley Klinkhammer]
Don't call it a fight
When you know it's a war
With nothing but your T-shirt on
(Midnight)
And go sit on the bed 'cause I know that you want to
(You come and pick me up, no headlights)
You got pretty eyes, but I know you're wrong
(Long drive)
And don't call it a spade if it isn't a spade
(Could end in burning flames or paradise)
And go lie on the floor if you want
(Fade into view)
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was they're too strong, too strong
(it's been a while since I have even heard from you)
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong

[Chorus: Haley Klinkhammer]
And you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down
We come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

[Verse 2: Mikael Olsson & Haley Klinkhammer]
(So it goes)
Yeah, counting cards was the best job he ever had
(He can't keep his wild eyes on the road)
Cleaning up
He's got good with his 4's and his 2's
(Takes me home)
Community service was the best job he ever had
(Lights are off, he's taking off his coat)
Cleaning up
He got sick on the floor and his shoes
And I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl
Some other girl


[Pre-Chorus: Haley Klinkhammer]
He says, ""What you've heard is true but I
Can't stop thinking about you,"" and I
I said ""I've been there too a few times""

[Chorus: Haley Klinkhammer]
And you've got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style

[Verse 3: Mikael Olsson]
Yeah well, she said, ""It's your birthday
Are you feeling alright?""
The next one's the MD
You'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there
You said that you felt snide
You hope that that boy will be alright

[Chorus: Haley Klinkhammer]
And you've got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style
We never go out of style


[Outro: Mikael Olsson & Haley Klinkhammer]
(Just take me home)
Yeah, if you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
(Just take me home)
Yeah, if you wanna find love, then you know where the city is
(Just take me home)
Yeah, if you wanna find love, then you know where the city is, the city is
Yeah, if you wanna find love, then you know where the city is"

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

Should’ve Said No (Live from SoHo) Lyrics
[Intro]
You should've said, ""No""
You  should've gone home
You  should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me

[Verse 1]
It's  strange to think the songs we used to sing
The  smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even  now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
And Yyu say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You  should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet

You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me


[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
And you say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
Well, I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No no, no, no, no, no


[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've know that word, 'bout what you did with her
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me
Thank you"

Anti-Hero Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tirеd of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's mе, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees


[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Today Was a Fairytale (Pop Mix) Lyrics
[Intro]
Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale

[Verse 1]
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around

[Chorus]
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must havе been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been thе way
Today was a fairytale


[Verse 2]
Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale

[Pre-Chorus]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around, yeah

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Bridge]
Time slows down
Whenever you're around
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down


[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way

[Chorus]
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale

[Outro]
Oh, oh, yeah, oh
Today was a fairytale"

Sparks Fly Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm
I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless
That should send me running
But I kinda know that I won't get far
You stood there in front of me
Just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see
What I was thinking of

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt mе when you're not around
I see sparks fly whenеver you smile

[Verse 2]
My mind forgets to remind me
You're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really something
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you I know it's no good
I could wait patiently but I really wish you would


[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile

[Bridge]
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keeping your eyes on me
It's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase
Won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show

[Chorus]
Drop everything now
Meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk
Take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
I see sparks fly whenever you smile


[Outro]
And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly"
Taylor Swift’s Solo Act,https://genius.com/Wall-street-journal-taylor-swifts-solo-act-annotated,"1 Contributor
Taylor Swift’s Solo Act Lyrics
Taylor Swift recently moved out of her parents' home into her own condo here.
 Now she's declaring her musical independence, too.

The country singer wrote every song by herself on her new album ""Speak Now,"" the first that she's completed without co-writers.
 The lyrics deal with real people—including rapper Kanye West, who famously interrupted her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.
 ""I write songs that are like diary entries,"" Ms. Swift says, adding: ""I have to do it in order to feel sane.""

Ms. Swift released her self-titled debut in 2006 at age 16. Her follow-up, ""Fearless,"" was the best-selling album in the U.S. in 2009, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and this January it won the Grammy for album of the year. On her new album, due out Monday, the 20-year-old Ms. Swift is looking to appeal to a more mature audience, even if it means leaving some of the Disney/Nickelodeon set behind.

""Speak Now"" features a TMZ-style attack on an unnamed starlet. ""She's an actress / she's better known for the things that she does on the mattress,"" Ms. Swift sings on the track ""Better Than Revenge.""
 In the song ""Never Grow Up,"" she writes about moving into a new apartment. ""It's so much colder than I thought it would be,"" she sings.


Ms. Swift came for an interview to Café Coco, a spot she frequents with her girlfriends. Accompanied by a security man complete with earpiece, she armed herself with a Rice Krispie treat and talked about her fans, her critics and her album.


The Wall Street Journal: Your voice has sometimes been criticized for not being all that strong, especially in live performances. How do you feel about that?

Ms. Swift: I don't really have a standard criticism policy for how I handle it. Because it seems like it's always something different that's being said in a different way by a different person…There are some times when I can just brush it off and be fine after I hear something negative. But there are times when it absolutely levels me.

Tell me about the song ""Mean"" on your new album.

""Mean"" is about this—I'm used to criticism because that's part of what I do, taking criticism. When it's constructive I have an appreciation for it, but when it crosses a line, and becomes mean, I write songs like that about it.


With a young audience following you, is it hard to grow up and write honestly about adult experiences?


Factoring in millions of people when I'm writing a song is not a good idea. I don't ever do it.

What about in your day-to-day life?

When I was 8 years old, it mattered what my favorite singer said and wore and expressed opinions about. And if I have a chance to matter to the growth and hopes and wishes of little girls, that's something I can't take lightly. So I do factor them in when I'm thinking about what to wear, and what to say, and whether or not to go out to bars even though I'm not 21.


Why did you go without co-writers on ""Speak Now""?

It originally was inspired by circumstance. I would get inspired to write a song at 3:30 in the morning. There's no co-writer around.


Were you trying to prove something to the world as an artist by writing everything yourself?

I just felt like all these crazy things were happening in my life.

Can you give me an example?

Different relationships. Realizations you come to based on the beginning and ending of those relationships and everything you learn in between. You have people come into your life shockingly and surprisingly. You have losses that you never thought you'd experience. You have rejection and you have learn how to deal with that and how to get up the next day and go on with it.

Are you going to scare boyfriends away because they might end up in one of your songs if things don't go so well?

The only thing I can say about that is that this is not a surprise that I do this. Everyone has had fair warning. This is my third album. I've never been shy or secretive with the fact that if you walk into my life, you may be walking onto a record.

The title song on the album is about a woman who dreams about interrupting the wedding of a guy she likes. Is that based on anything in your real life?

Well, I've never interrupted a wedding. But if I did, that's how I would do it. A few of my friends had ex-boyfriends who were getting married. And I went through that with them in venting sessions…And of course I started having dreams about what if my ex-boyfriend got married to someone else? So a lot of the songs on this record are pulled straight from my life. Then there are songs like ""Speak Now"" that are an extension of my feelings and hypothetically what I would do.


Do you feel that your early fame has cut you off from experiences that might have fed into your songwriting? Any regrets that you became so successful so young?

I heard a quote from Dolly Parton one time and she said that regrets aren't fair to you because you couldn't possibly have known then what you know now. And a lot of times I wish I could live life more like her. Just this clarity about how to process regret. But on this particular subject about the path that I chose in life I do not regret anything. I'm very aware and very conscious of the path I chose in life, and very aware of the path I didn't choose.

So what was the path you didn't choose?


My parents were in finance. They thought I was going to be a stockbroker and go to business school and college—and my brother's at Notre Dame. All my friends are at college. I keep one eye on the path I didn't choose every day. That's why I go and attend journalism classes at my friend Abigail's college. Because I just want to sit there and see what it's like for a day. That's why I go to Notre Dame and visit my brother and sit in his dorm room. The life I chose is very different from theirs."

Juliet Lyrics
[Intro: Taylor Swift]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts

[Verse: SHIKI XO]
I was getting in at the UPS
I'm telling u I ain't gon stay away from juliet
Baby you're so bad for me you're like a cigarette
And I see you in the shadows like a silhouette
Baby this ain't a love story cuz I don't know like how to feel
This love so difficult, I don't think it's real
But do you remember white sheets, bloodstained kisses
I don't wanna miss this, you could be my mistress
You could bе my lady
Juliet save me
I just want my baby
Plеase juliet save me

Cuz we were both young when I first saw you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said


[Verse 2: SHIKI XO]
I could tell you what you wanna hear cuz I don't wanna be alone
But love is not a fairy tale, I waited but you never come
And I got tired of waiting, wondered if you'd ever come around
I need you bae, I need you baby baby when I'm coming down

And I just need my lady
Juliet save me
I'm so tired of waiting
Juliet save me

Cuz we were both young when I first saw you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said

""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say yes""

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

ME! (Miles Away Remix) Lyrics
[Intro]:
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1]:
I know that I’m a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble’s gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
Me-e-e


[Drop]
Me-e-e
Me-e-e
Me-e-e
Me-e-e
Me-e-e
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Verse 2]
’Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin’ in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]:
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I’m the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Drop]
Me-e-e
Me-e-e

And I promise that nobody’s gonna love you like me-e-e"

Back To December Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses, and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Staying up, playing back myself leaving
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
And I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side and
Realized I loved you in the fall


[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came
The dark days when fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love, and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tan skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinking
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standing in front of you, saying I'm sorry for that night
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missing you
Wishing I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I'd go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I'd go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
All the time"

'Cause baby now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look at what you've done

I was thinking you could be the trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shining? Now it's all rusted

And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds they last and they last now

[Amy]
Did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal but this won't
So if you come in my way just don't

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times

That’s When (Demo) Lyrics
[Intro: Brett Warren & Taylor Swift ]
You ready? Yeah, let's try
One, two, three, four

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I said, ""I know""
When he said, ""I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this""
And I watched him go
And he watched me crash to the floor
On my knees, just like that

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Then he said, ""When can I-I-I come back?""
I said

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Warren Brothers]
""That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, if I see your face, I'll let you in
Yeah, baby, that's when""

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
I said, ""I know""
When he said, ""I did you wrong, made mistakes
Put you through all of this”
'Cause I let you go, and you let me
Think that I'd be fine without you, imagine that


[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
So, baby, when can I come back?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Warren Brothers]
That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, if I see your face, I'll let you in
And baby, that's when

[Interlude: Brad Warren]
Do a bridge right here

[Bridge: Taylor Swift]
And I said, ""Honestly
Did you ever think of me?""
And he said

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & The Warren Brothers]
""That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's storming
When I was laughing, when I was crying
And that's when, I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, if I see your face, you let me in
And baby, that's when”


[Outro: Brad Warren, Taylor Swift, Both]
That's when, when I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or it's, oh-oh-oh, storming
Oh-oh-oh-oh, laughing, crying
Ah-ah, oh-oh That's when
Oh-oh-oh That's when
Oh-oh I'll let you in
Baby, that's when
I said, ""I know""
When he said, ""I need some time, need some space"""

What a shame
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said no one else, how could you do this, babe?

This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time

Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah

We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
We said, ""No one else"", how could you do this, babe?

This is the last time, this is the last time

Since you admitted it, I keep picturin'
Her lips on your neck, I can't unsee it
I hate that because of you, I can't love you
Babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?

[Chorus]
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe?
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you babe

How could you do this, babe?

Anti-Hero Lyrics
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)


It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out;
""She's laughing up at us from hell""

Oh fuck, it's me, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

My ex man brought his new girlfriend
She's like ""Oh my gosh!""
But I'm just gonna shake

[Dani]
And to the fella over there
With the heck good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
Shake shake shake

Woaaah

'Cause the players gonna play play play play play
And the haters gonna hate hate hate hate hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off

Heart breakers gonna break break break break break
And the fakers gonna fake fake fake fake fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake shake shake shake shake
Shake it off

Safe and Sound Lyrics
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said, I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Don't you dare look out your window darling
Everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gonе

Just close your eyes
Thе sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound


Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound"

The Moment I Knew Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You should've been there
Should've burst through the door
With that ""Baby, I'm right here"" smile
And it would've felt like
A million little shining stars had all aligned
And I would've been so happy

[Verse 2]
Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
And I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
And there's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew


[Verse 3]
And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your friends always seem to know
When there's something wrong
So they follow me down the hall
And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""

[Chorus]
And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
There's one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew

[Outro]
Ooh-oh-oh, oh, moment I knew
Ooh-oh-oh, oh
Oh, it's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
Cry if I want to, cry if I want to
It's my party and I'll cry if I want to
And I would've been so happy
I'll cry if I want to, ooh"

Midnight Rain (Clean) Lyrics
[Intro]
Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 1]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain

[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Verse 2]
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain


[Chorus]
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Outro]
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
(Midnights like this, midnights like this)"

Sweeter Than Fiction Lyrics
Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you hear is no
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and I, I, I, I

Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees, eh eh
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Some day you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever

There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
You eyes wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Just a shot, just a shot in the dark, oh oh
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're onto something, I, I, I say

What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
You eyes wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
You eyes wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I'll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I'll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud

And then they call your name and we
Put your picture in a frame
You now that I'll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when, when you

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was no
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever


There you'll stand, ten feet tall
I will say, I knew it all along
You eyes wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

There you'll stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
You eyes wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction

Is sweeter than fiction
Is sweeter, yeah
Is sweeter, is sweeter
Sweeter than fiction"

...Ready for It? Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Knew she was a killer first time that I saw her
Wonder how many guys she had loved and left haunted
But if she's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
I can hold her ransom-som
Some girls are tryin' too hard
She don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes but she acting like a woman, so
I see nothing better, I keep her forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gonna go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Me, I was a robber first time that she saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never saying sorry
But if I'm a thief, then she can join the heist
And we'll move to an island-and
Yeah, she can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every lover known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now


[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gonna go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time

[Refrain]
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gonna go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know


[Chorus]
In the middle of the night (Night), in my dreams (My dreams)
You should see the things we do (We do), baby (Baby), hmm (Yeah)
In the middle of the night, in my dreams (My dreams)
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time
In the middle of the night

Baby, let the games begin
Let the games begin
Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?
Baby, let the games begin

Let the games begin
Are you ready for it?"

Bejeweled (Mixed) [Jan 2023] Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight

[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

[Post-Chorus]
Nice

[Verse]
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)


[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

[Post-Chorus]
Nice

[Bridge]
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine


[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice

[Outro]
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer"

Enchanted Lyrics
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face

All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me

The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder till I'm wide awake
Now I'm pacing back and forth


Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you

This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name

Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you


This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonder struck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you"

Christmas Tree Farm Lyrics
[Intro]
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
Just like magic

[Verse 1]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true


[Verse 2]
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow

[Pre-Chorus]
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
Mistakes are forgiven
And everything is icy and blue
And you would be there too

[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
Baby, yeah

[Bridge]
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas (To you)


[Chorus]
Under the mistletoe (To you)
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, ""I love you""

[Outro]
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
I love you
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas"

The Fate of Ophelia Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me
I might’ve drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me, myself, and I
Right before you lit my sky up

[Chorus]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundrеd on the land (Land), the sea (Sеa), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) ’cause now (Now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia


[Verse 2]
The eldest daughter of a nobleman
Ophelia lived in fantasy
But love was a cold bed full of scorpions
The venom stole her sanity

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me (Come for me)
I might've lingered in purgatory
You wrap around me like a chain (A chain), a crown (A crown), a vine (A vine)
Pulling me into the fire

[Chorus]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you’ve been (Been) ’cause now (Now) you're mine
It’s 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia


[Breaking Down/Bridge]
'Tis locked inside my memory
And only you possess the key
No longer drowning and deceived
All because you came for me
Locked inside my memory
And only you possess the key
No longer drowning and deceived
All because you came for me

[Chorus]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (I can see it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands (Your hands), your team, your vibes
Don’t care where the hell you've been (You've been) 'cause now ('Cause now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of

Fifteen Lyrics
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the morning of your very first day
You say ""Hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hoping one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know I haven't seen you around before.""

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen
Feeling like there's nothing to figure out
Wеll count to ten, take it in
This is life bеfore you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough you're best friends
Laughing at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be out of here as soon as we can
And then you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feeling like flying
And you're momma's waiting up and you think he's the one
And you're dancing 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
When you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin round but
In your life you'll do things greater
Than dating the boy of the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

And Abigail gave everything she had to a boy
Who changed his mind and we both cried

'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found that time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be at fifteen

La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
La la la la la la la


Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"

You’re On Your Own Kid (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodiеs
Just to learn that you never carеd

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Verse 2]
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away


[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid


[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been"

Ours Lyrics
Elevator buttons and morning air
Stranger silence makes me wanna take the stairs
If you were here we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs...

Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury is out, but my choice is you...

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The water is rough
But this love is ours...

You never know what people have up their sleeves
The ghosts from your past are gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But i don't care, 'cause right now you're mine
And you'll say...

Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high
The water is rough
But this love is ours...


And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are aware, my belonging
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you...

'cause i love the gap between your teeth
And i love the riddles that you speak
And and any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, cause my heart is yours...

So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
And don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high
The water is rough
But this love is ours..."

Should’ve Said No (Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday I found out about you
Even now just looking at you: feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back, given one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet

You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been crying
Baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?


[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past, you need one chance
It was a moment of weakness and you said, ""Yes""

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no, baby, and you might still have me

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?

No no, no, no

[Chorus]
You should've said, ""No""
You should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word, 'bout what you did with her’d
Get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself, ""Why?""
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet

This Is What You Came For (Tony Junior Remix) Lyrics
[Chorus: Rihanna]
Baby, this is what you came for
Lightning strikes every time she moves
And everybody's watching her
But she's looking at you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, you, oh, oh
You, oh, oh, oh, oh

We go fast with the game we play
Who knows why it's gotta be this way?
We say nothing more than we need
I say ""your place"" when we leave

You, oh, oh, oh

NMPA Songwriter Icon Award Speech Lyrics
I’m really, really honored to be receiving this award because it honors the part of my job that is so magical and mystical to me, still. I love songwriting so much because there’s an element to it that is still really mysterious — like I think any songwriter will tell you, when you get an idea you’re not quite sure where it floated down from, but if you can grab onto that idea and turn it into something, a piece of music, that’s where craftsmanship comes in; that’s where you have thе opportunity to learn and to nurture that craft,
 and I want to take a momеnt to thank the people who were my professors, my teachers, of the craft of songwriting.

First of all, to anyone who wrote with me in Nashville when I was in eighth or ninth grade: That is insane that you did that, and I am so lucky that I got to learn from some of the best writers on Music Row. Liz Rose was someone who spent hours and hours and hours with me when there was absolutely no sign that anything would happen in my career.
 My dance card was not full, I was 14, and she wrote with me so many times and taught me how to edit my ideas down into something that would pack an emotional punch.

Then, later in my career, I got to work with Max Martin and Johan Shellback, who I learned so much from [in] a melodic sense, and I will carry those lessons with me for the rest of my life. I will learn more lessons from them next time we work together, and I feel really lucky that they’ve been a part of my life.


Jack Antonoff is such a wonderful creator and such a nurturing presence — with his own art and other artists, he’s just so versatile and such a wonderful friend.
 Aaron Dessner came into my life recently, and he is just such a prolific creator.
 All of these people changed my writing and helped shape it.

There are so many others, though. So if you’ve ever sat in a room and cowritten with me, thank you so much. Anyone who’s ever wanted to produce one of my songs, any collaborator I’ve ever had — I’ve learned from all of you. I want to say thank you to Troy Tomlinson for always being excited to hear new songs of mine, and to Jody Gerson for being such a champion of female songwriters throughout the industry.

This is something I am so proud to receive. And to the fans who are out there who care about my lyrics — you have no idea how much it means to me that you dissect them and copy them into your journals and care about the words that I write.

There are amazing songwriters who came before me who deserve this, there are incredible songwriters coming up now who are so impressive and amazing: I have such an affinity and respect for all of you. I am honored to receive this. Thank you so much."

Teardrops on my Guitar (Live from Clear Channel Stripped 2008) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's so damn funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus 2]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...


[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can't he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be

[Pre-Chorus 3]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishing on a wishing star
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...

[Bridge]
So I drive home alone, as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who’s got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car
I keep singing, don't know why I do...


[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see"

Me! Lyrics
[Intro]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


[Verse 2]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
And there's a lot of lame guys out there
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
And there's a lot of lame guys out there

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

Lover Lyrics
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"

I Don’t Wanna Live Forever (Fifty Shades Darker) [Acoustic] Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like it's no point hoping at all

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
Until you come back home, oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my lifе

[Pre-Chorus]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you somеthing, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?


[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
Until you come back home, oh-oh

[Bridge]
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?

Father Figure (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When I found you, you were young, wayward, lost in the cold
Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold
The winding road leads to the chateau
""You remind me of a younger me,"" I saw potential

[Chorus]
I'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my check's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
I dry your tears with my sleeve

[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family

[Verse 2]
I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain
Said, ""They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign""
I showed you all the tricks of the trade
All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé

[Chorus]
I'll be your father figure, I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my check's bigger
This love is pure profit, just step into my office
They'll know your name in the streets


[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family

[Bridge]
I saw a change in you (I saw a change, saw a change in you)
My dear boy
They don't make loyalty like they used to (Not like they used to)
Your thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition
On foolish decisions, which led to misguided visions
That to fulfill your dreams
You had to get rid of me
I protect the family

[Chorus]
I was your father figure, we drank that brown liquor
You made a deal with this devil, turns out my check's bigger
You want a fight? You found it, I got the place surrounded
You'll be sleeping with the fishes before you know you're drowning
Whose portrait's on the mantel? Who covered up your scandals?
Mistake my kindness for weakness and find your card cancelled
I was your father figure, you pulled the wrong trigger
This empire belongs to me

[Post-Chorus]
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me


[Outro]
""You know, you remind me of a younger me""
I saw potential"

You All Over Me (Demo) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Once the last drop of rain
Has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
The way the tires turn stones
On old county roads
They leave it muddy underneath
Reminds me of you

[Verse 2]
You find graffiti on the walls
Of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket
That's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me

[Chorus]
And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, held on
God knows too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Sworе that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gеts you clean
I've still got you all over me


[Verse 3]
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now, every breath of air I breathe
Reminds me of back then

[Chorus]
And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows too long
And wasted my time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me

[Instrumental Bridge]

[Chorus]
I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around see
That we were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I tried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me


[Outro]
I've still got you all, oh-oh, over me
Na-na-na
Na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na
La-da-dum, la-da-dum
La-da-da-da, all over me
Da-da-dum, la-la-da
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na
Na-na-na, na-na-na, na
All over you, you all over me
Ah-oh, oh-oh, oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, yeah
Oh-oh-oh, yeah, ah, oh
All over me"

The Tortured Poets Department (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
I think some things I never say
Like, ""Who uses typewriters anyway?""
But you're in self-sabotage mode
Throwing spikes down on the road
But I've seen this episode and still loved the show
Who else decodes you?

[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
And who's gonna know you, if not me?
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
Nobody
Nobody

[Verse 2]
You smoked, then ate seven bars of chocolate
We declared Charlie Puth should be a bigger artist
I scratch your head, you fall asleep
Like a tattooed golden retriever
But you awaken with dread
Pounding nails in your head
But I've read this one where you come undone
I chose this cyclone with you


[Chorus]
And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
And who's gonna know you like me?
(Who's gonna know you?)
I laughed in your face and said
""You're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're modern idiots""
And who's gonna hold you like me?
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)

[Post-Chorus]
Nobody
(Who's gonna hold you? Who's gonna hold you?)
Nobody
(Who's gonna hold you? Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?)
Nobody

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wonder if you're gonna screw this up with me
But you told Lucy you'd kill yourself if I ever leave
And I had said that to Jack about you, so I felt seen
Everyone we know understands why it's meant to be
'Cause we're crazy
So tell me, who else is gonna know me?
At dinner, you take my ring off my middle finger
And put it on the one people put wedding rings on
And that's the closest I've come to my heart exploding


[Chorus]
Who's gonna hold you? (Who?)
Me
Who's gonna know you? (Who?)
Me
And you're not Dylan Thomas, I'm not Patti Smith
This ain't the Chelsea Hotel, we're two idiots
Who's gonna hold you?

[Post-Chorus]
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Who's gonna hold you?
Gonna know you? Gonna troll you?

You left your typewriter at my apartment
Straight from the tortured poets department
Who else decodes you?"

You’re On Your Own, Kid Lyrics
[Verse 1: Kellin Quinn]
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, she's gonna notice me
It’s okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway (Let's go!)
I hear it in your voice, you’re smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

[Pre-Chorus: The Frst & Kellin Quinn]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared

[Chorus: The Frst & Kellin Quinn]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Verse 2: The Frst]
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, she loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away


[Pre-Chorus: The Frst & Kellin Quinn]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

[Chorus: The Frst & Kellin Quinn]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Interlude: The frst & Kellin Quinn]
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh (You’re on your own, you’re on your own)
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, (Yeah), ooh (You're on your own, you’re on your own)
Ooh, ooh, ooh (Yeah)

[Bridge: The Frst & Kellin Quinn]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can’t take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid


[Chorus: Kellin Quinn & The frst]
You're on your own, kid, you're on your own
Yeah, you can face this, you're on your own
You're on your own, kid
You always have been"

I ain't even make a dime (""X"" is the shape I drew through your face)
When is it gonna be my time? (In permanent marker, oh, yeah)
My time to shine (Just like the mark you knew you were making)
I should just stop trying (Who do you think you are to write on his heart?)

Cruel Summer Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (You know that I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (You know that I want it...)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh-oh-woah
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, oh-oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of thе vending machine
I'm not dying (I'm not dyin')
We say that wе'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Not trying)


[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh-oh-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, oh-oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (oh)
Said, ""I'm fine, "" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through (Snuck in through) the garden gate (The garden gate)
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (oh)
And I scream, ""For what it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinning like a devil


[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh-oh-woah
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, oh-woah
It's a cruel summer
With you"

Blank Space Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" Oh, oh
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors lie
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"

Me! Lyrics
[Intro]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


[Verse 2]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge]
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
I promise that you'll never find another like


[Chorus]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro]
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a ""me""
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh)
Baby, that's the fun of me
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
You can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e"

Love Story Lyrics
[Verse 1: Ryan]
We were both young when I first saw you
Close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
You say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus: Tommy]
'Cause you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
My daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus: Zach]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2: James]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while


[Pre-Chorus: Tommy]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
My daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus: Zach & all]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus: Zach]
Oh, oh

[Bridge: Pedro]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus: Zach]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""


[Outro: Zach]
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Look What You Made Me Do Lyrics
PENNYWISE
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't true, no, I don't like you (oh!)

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do

ADRIAN
Hey, Pennywise, Bette Midler called. She wants her look back


PENNYWISE
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (nick of time)
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

I'm sorry, the old Penny can't come to the phone right now Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do

Mine (2010) Lyrics
You're at your job working part time waiting tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love if it never lasts

I say can you believe it?
As we’re lying on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Flash forward and we’re taking on the world together
And there's a bunch of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about

Do you remember we were sitting there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that’s ever been mine

And I remember that fight, two thirty pm
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street

Braced myself for the goodbye
’Cause that's all I’ve ever known
And you took me by surprise
You said I'll never leave you alone

You said I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that’s ever been mine

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Hold on
Do you believe it? Hold on
We're gonna make it now, yes, yes
And I can see it, yes, yes
I can see it now"

Bejeweled (Mixed) Lyrics
[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice

[Post-Chorus]
Nice

[Verse]
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl (Too good of a girl)
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world (Huh), have you heard? (Huh)
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you (Miss you), but I miss sparklin' (Nice)

[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice


[Post-Chorus]
Nice

[Bridge]
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine

[Chorus]
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer (Shimmer)
And when I meet the band
They ask, ""Do you have a man?""
I could still say, ""I don't remember""
Familiarity breeds contempt
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real (Nice), I polish up real nice


[Outro]
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

​vigilante shit* Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

[Chorus]
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

[Verse 2]
She needed cold, hard proof, so I gavе her some
She had thе envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Drivin' in your Benz
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge

[Chorus]
She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately, she's been dressing for revenge


[Bridge]
Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough

[Verse 3]
While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents
I'm on my vigilante shit again

[Chorus]
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge"

Cardigan Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, thеy assume you know nothing


[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving mе your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing


[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind

Pretty Words Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Well I guess that you are supposed
To be all I'll ever need
Apparently
The one who loved to make
Sense of everything
According to the
Talk in this town that spins around in my mind
They try to sell me a feeling that I ain't buying

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody knows pretty words, they come and go
As easy a fool believes
So don't you go expecting me to fall because
You whispered yours to me
I ain't your stupid girl
Chasing pretty words

[Verse 2]
Now what makes you think that your gamble
Is gonna pay off on me?
Are you that lucky?
After I watched you smile as they cry
You trade them so easily
For being free
So I'd best get wise to the game that you play
Or I'm only gonna have myself to blame


[Chorus]
Yeah, everybody knows pretty words, they come and go
As easy as a fool believes
So don't you go expecting me to fall because
You whispered yours to me
And I ain't your stupid girl
Chasing pretty words

[Bridge]
Yeah try as you will to chip away at this stone
But in the end you'll find yourself alone

[Chorus]
'Cause everybody knows pretty words, they come and go
As easy as a fool believes
So don't you go expecting me to fall because
You whispered yours to me
Now everybody knows pretty words, they come and go
As easy as a fool believes
So don't you go expecting me to fall because
You whispered yours to me
I ain't your stupid girl
Chasing pretty words"

I Hate It Here x the lakes Lyrics
Quick, quick
Tell me something awful
Like you are a poet trapped inside the body of a finance guy
Tell me all your secrets
All you'll ever be is
My eternal consolation prize
You see I was a debutant in another life but
Now I seem to be scared to go outside
If comfort is a construct
I don't believe in good luck
Now that I know what's what

I hate it here so I will go to
Secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to
The only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small town fears
I'm there most of the year
Cause I hate it here
I hate it here

Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones


Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

I'm lonely but I'm good
I'm bitter but I swear I'm fine
I'll save all my romanticism for my inner life and I'll get lost on
Purpose
This place made me feel worthless
Lucid dreams like electricity, the current flies through me
And in my fantasies I rise above it
And way up there, I actually love it

A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief

Take me to the lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse

I hate it here so I will go to
Secret gardens in my mind
People need a key to get to
The only one is mine
I read about it in a book when I was a precocious child
No mid-sized city hopes and small town fears


I hate it here so I will go to
Lunar valleys in my mind
When they found a better planet
Only the gentle survived
I dreamed about it in the dark
The night I felt like I might die
No mid-sized city hopes and small town fears
I'm there most of the year
Cause I hate it here

So, take me to the lakes
I hate it here
So, take me to the lakes
Take me to the lakes
Where all the poets went to die
I don't belong, and my beloved, neither do you
And those Windermere peaks
Look like the perfect place to cry
So I’m setting off
But not without my muse, no not without you"

Getaway Car Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It was the best of times, the worst of crimes
I struck a match and blew your mind
But I didn't mean it
And you didn't see it
The ties were black, the lies were white
In shades of gray in candlelight
I wanted to leave him
I needed a reason

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, I was lyin' to myself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car


[Verse 2]
It was the great escape, the prison break
The light of freedom on my face
But you weren't thinkin'
And I was just drinkin'
While he was runnin' after us, I was screamin', ""Go, go, go!""
But with three of us, honey, it's a sideshow
And a circus ain't a love story
And now we're both sorry (We're both sorry)

[Pre-Chorus]
""X"" marks the spot where we fell apart
He poisoned the well, every man for himself
I knew it from the first Old Fashioned, we were cursed
It hit you like a shotgun shot to the heart

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car


[Bridge]
We were jet-set, Bonnie and Clyde
Until I switched to the other side
To the other si-i-i-i-ide
It's no surprise I turned you in
'Cause us traitors never win
I'm in a getaway car
I left you in a motel bar
Put the money in a bag and I stole the keys
That was the last time you ever saw me

[Chorus]
Drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Should've known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me
In a getaway car, oh-oh-oh
No, they never get far, oh-oh-ahh
No, nothing good starts in a getaway car

[Outro]
I was ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car
Ridin' in a getaway car
I was cryin' in a getaway car
I was dyin' in a getaway car
Said goodbye in a getaway car"

You Belong With Me (Cover) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humour like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the type of music she doesn't like
'Cause she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the wholе time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who undеrstands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the street with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me all your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"

Breathe Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time

[Break]
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm-mm-mm

[Verse 2]
The music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now I don't know what to be without you around

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

[Verse 3]
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes it doesn't work out
And nothin' we say is gonna save us from the fallout


[Pre-Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand

[Chorus]
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to

[Bridge]
It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M., feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me

[Pre-Chorus]
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh

[Chorus]
I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

[Outro]
I'm sorry, I'm sorry (Mmm)
I'm sorry, (Yeah, yeah) I'm sorry

Safe and Sound Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember tears streaming down your face when I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said don't leave me here alone
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2]
Don't you dare look out your window, darling everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold onto this lullaby even when the music's gone

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes, the sun is going down
You'll be alright, no one can hurt you now
Come morning light, you and I'll be safe and sound
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

Just close your eyes, you'll be alright"

Cardigan (triple j Like a Version) Lyrics
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young
They assume you know nothing
Sequined smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young
They assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levis
Drunk under a streetlight, ah, ah, ah, ah
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, ah, ah, ah, ah
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favourite

A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you arе young
They assume you know nothing

But I knew you
Playing hidе-and-seek
And giving me your weekends, ah, ah, ah, ah
I knew you
Heartbeat on the high-line
Once or twenty lifetimes, ah, ah, ah, ah
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favourite


To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Mark me like a bloodstain, ah, ah, ah, ah
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losin' Wendy, ah, ah, ah, ah
I knew you
Leavin' like the father
Running like water, ah, ah
When you are young
They assume you know nothing

But I knew you'd linger like a tattooed kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
You'd come back


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put on, and said I was your favourite"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up
Saying, ""This is it, I had enough""
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed ""space""
Then you come around again and say
""I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Called it off again last night
But oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever getting back together

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And falling for it, screaming that I'm right
You hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record cooler than mine


[Pre-Chorus]
And oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Called me up again tonight
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever getting back together

[Instrumental Interlude]

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever getting back together"

[Verse 1]
Betty, I won't make assumptions bout why you left your homeroom but I think its cause of me
Betty one day I was riding on my skateboard when I passed your house it's like I couldn't breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
I'm not usually this forward but now I wanna be
With your hands on top of me
I know your type and honestly
It's not serious
It's just an experience
I'll be your experiment
We'll do it for the hell of it

[Chorus]
Call your boyfriend
Tell him he's fine
He's just no longer your type
You've got someone elsе on your mind
Call your boyfriend
Said we're going stеady
Tell him ""whenever you're ready""
I just decided that I like Betty"

The Story Of Us (Commentary) Lyrics
[Spoken Word: Becca Walls]
""Speak Now"" is Taylor Swift's third studio album, and the amazing thing is that she wrote every single song by herself. That is not easy to do but she made it look easy, and this next song, she wrote about a very awkward situation with an ex

[Spoken Word: Taylor Swift]
""The Story Of Us"" is a song that I wrote about an awkward situation where I had um, happened to run into exes in strange places lately, and this is about one of those situations where the strange place that I ran into him was an award show. And um, I was seated a couple seats away from him and just sort of like, there was so much that needed to be said, and neither one of us are willing to say it. We're both like, acting like we're so engaged in this conversation next to us with this person that we don't even know. I'm having a great time, aren't you? You know, 'cause I don't care what you think at all. You know, it was just miserable. And so, I was telling my mom about it later and I was just sorta like, I felt like I was standing alone in a crowded room. That's what the song is about

[Spoken Word: Becca Walls]
I have to imagine, in that room all eyes were on Taylor and her ex, trying to see how they were going to interact or not interact so, I'm sure that just added to the awkwardness, but this is ""The Story Of Us"" off of Taylor Swift's ""Speak Now"" on Big Machine Radio"

[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two


[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
(Hey!) I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh), twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two (Ooh)


[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you (You)
Woah, ooh, yeah, eh-yeah

[Chorus]
(Hey!) I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're (Dancing like we're twenty-two)

It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)

The Man Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you

[Pre-Chorus]
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes you
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, thеn I'd be the man
I'd be thе man, yeah
I'd be the man

[Verse 2]
They'd say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves


[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
I'd be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man, yeah
I'd be the man, yeah

[Bridge]
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashing my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (You know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man (If I was a man)
Then I'd be the man (Then I'd be the man)
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can (As fast as I can)
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (Oh)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (Coming at me again)
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man, yeah (I'd be the man, oh)
I'd be the man, yeah (I'd be the man, yeah)

Love Story (Commentary) Lyrics
[Spoken: Becca]
We're taking a look back on Taylor Swift's album Fearless, which is celebrating its tenth anniversary this fall
And this next song is perhaps one of the most successful of Taylor Swift's career
At one point it was the best-selling digital country single of all time in the US
It's been certified eight times platinum in the US, meaning it sold over 8 million copies
And its been certified seven times platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association
I'm talking about Love Story and here's what Taylor said she was thinking about when she wrote this song

[Spoken: Taylor Swift]
It's about lovе that isn't easy and its not simple, I don't think that it should be nеcessarily
If love is worth it, if its that good, if its worth fighting for
Then you know its the right love, you're willing to fight for it
I wanted to portray some sort of symbolic message of that in the video
And that is, you know, running away from the castle and running through a field and meeting up in the middle
That was my symbolic way of love being worth fighting for
And so, I think that, yeah, you can have love that's easy and simple and all that
But I think that its a lot more fun when its something you've gotta work for and fight for because its that worth it

[Spoken: Becca]
Like I said, this is probably one of the most successful songs off Taylor's Fearless album, if not in her entire career
This is Love Story on Big Machine Radio"

Guilty as Sin? Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Drownin' in the Blue Nile
She sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into her tonight, she's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?

[Chorus]
What if she's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' her skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Verse 2]
I keep thеse longings locked
In lowercasе, inside a vault
Someone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?


[Chorus]
What if she's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
My bed sheets are ablaze
I've screamed her name
Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
Without ever touchin' her skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

[Bridge]
What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously

[Chorus]
What if she's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' her skin
How can I be guilty as sin?


[Outro]
She sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
Am I allowed to cry?"

mad woman (clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Does she smile?
Or does she mouth, ""I hate you forever""?

[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Verse 2]
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say, ""Move on,"" but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together


[Pre-Chorus]
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
What about that?
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry

[Chorus]
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman

[Bridge]
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but
No one likes a mad woman

[Outro]
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that"

Tim McGraw Lyrics
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said ""That's a lie""

Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him
All summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness

I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here to see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read from three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that
It's nice to believe


But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness

I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standing on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read is

But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness

I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Ah, think of me
Mmmm


He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said ""That's a lie"""

Me! Lyrics
[Intro]
I promise that you'll never find another like me

[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
(And there's a lot of cool chicks out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
But one of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of thе colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promisе that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


[Verse 2]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
(And there's a lot of lame guys out there)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause one of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge]
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
I promise that you'll never find another like


[Chorus]
Me-e-e (Yeah), ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (And I want ya, baby)
I'm the only one of me (I'm the only one of me)
Baby, that's the fun of me (Baby, that's the fun of me)
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Oh)
You're the only one of you (Oh)
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro]
Girl, there ain't no I in ""team"" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
But you know there is a ""me""
I'm the only one of me (Oh-oh)
Baby, that's the fun of me
(Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
You can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e"

us. (Live) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I know you know
It felt just like a joke
I show, you don't
And now we're talkin'
I know your ghost
I see her through the smoke
She'll play her show
And you'll be watchin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And if history's clear, someone always ends up in ruins
And what seemed like fate becomes ""What the hell was I doin'?""
Babylon lovers hangin' lifetimes on a vine (Ooh)
Do you miss mine?

[Chorus]
Do you miss us, us?
I felt it, you held it, do you miss us, us?
Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us
Us (Us), us (Us), us (Us)

[Verse 2]
I know you know
It felt like somethin' old
It felt like somethin' holy, like souls bleedin', so
It felt like what I've known
You're twenty-nine years old
So how can you be cold when I open my home?


[Pre-Chorus]
And if history's clear, the flames always end up in ashes
And what seemed like fate, give it ten months and you'll be past it (You'll be past it)
Babylon lovers hangin' missed calls on the line
I gave you mine

[Chorus]
Did you mind us, us?
I felt it, you held it, do you miss us, us?
Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us
Us (Us), us (Us), us (Us)

[Bridge]
That night, you were talkin' false prophets and profits
They make in the margins of poetry sonnets
You never read up on it, shame, could've learned somethin'
Robert Bly on my nightstand, gifts from you, how ironic
The curse or a miracle, hearse or an oracle
You're incomparable, fuck, it was chemical
You (You) plus (Plus) me (Me) was

[Chorus]
Us, us, us
I felt it, you held it, do you miss us, us?
Wonder if you regret the secret of us, us
Mistaken for strangers the way it was, was
The pain of, the reign of, the flame of us, us
The outline, well, sometimes, do you miss us, us?
The best kind, well, sometimes, do you miss us?"

I'm the only one of me

And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like
-Promise that nobody's gonna love you like (Me-e-e)

Long Live (Commentary) Lyrics
[Spoken Word: Becca Walls]
Taylor Swift, her career has been unbelievable. She has achieved so many things, but one thing that she knows is that she has not done it alone. Taylor has been surrounded by so many incredible people who have helped her achieve her dreams and beyond. And that is what she wrote this next song about. It's called ""Long Live""

[Spoken Word: Taylor Swift]
This song for me is like looking at a photo album of all the award shows and all the stadium shows and all the hands in the air in the crowd. And it's sort of the first love song that I've written to my team
[Spoken Word: Becca Walls]
Short and sweet but I think she got the message across. This is ""Long Live"" off Taylor Swift's Speak Now album on Big Machine Radio"

Anti-Hero (Mixed) [2022 MegaMix] Lyrics
[Intro: DJ Khaled]
That's right, Apple Music
2022 MegaMix

[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero


[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed

[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Bad Blood Lyrics
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
Hey, now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"

I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees


[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

The World We Need Lyrics
The world we need



Take my hand and we’ll escape from this world tonight

It’s time to take a stand. Are you with me? Well, come on!



Looking at you looking at me
Risking it all for the world we need

No other place. No other time
None of the things that there used to be

Kicking the doors. Kicking the walls
Why in the hell don’t you come along?



Can’t you see what I’m talking about?
Now it’s time to turn the world around

Make a Pact. Make a plan
Join together hand in hand


Day to night. Night to day
Take it all, then give it away

Tell me now whatcha gonna do when you got no sun sitting over you

It can’t be right. It can’t be true
If hope lives on will our dreams come true?

Catch a wave. Catch a break
Catch the lies politicians make

You’re to me what I’m to you
Brighten your smile when the world turns blue

Tell me the truth, then tell me a lie
Cover yourself with an alibi



I’ll do it for you if you do it for me
Take a stand for eternity

Open your heart. Open your mind
Open the door to the world we need




Our world is gone. It slipped away
Our world is gone. It slipped away
Our world is gone. It slipped away
Our world is gone. It slipped away"

We Found Love [Leondis Remix] / You Belong With Me (Mixed) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Just maybe
You belong with me
You belong with me
Belong with me
You belong with me
Belong with me
You belong with me


[Verse 2: Taylor Swift]
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Belong with me
You belong with me
Belong with me
You belong with me"

Back to December (International Mix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why

[Pre-Chorus]
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time

[Verse 2]
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall


[Pre-Chorus]
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye

[Chorus]
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

[Bridge]
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand

[Chorus]
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time


[Outro]
All the time"

Fortnight (snippet) Lyrics
All my mornings are Mondays
Stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move on drug
The effects were temporary

And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
But I touched you
I touched you

And for a fortnight
There we were; forever
Run into you sometimes
Ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard
Turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers
I wanna kill her"

Our Song (Live Acoustic 2006) Lyrics
[Intro]
My name's Taylor Swift
I've, huh, been pretty privileged to put together an album which I've written every song
And, huh, about half of them are cowrites and half of them are ones I just wrote by myself, so I figured I'd play one of those
This is called ""Our Song""

[Verse 1]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we'rе on the phone and you talk real slow
'Causе it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again


[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said

[Chorus]
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again


[Bridge]
And
 I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again


[Post-Chorus]
Play it again, oh yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Outro]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying this is it, i've had enough, 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space
Then you come around again and say
Baby, i miss you and i swear i'm gonna change, trust me
Remember how that lasted for a day
I say i hate you, we break up, you call me, i love you

We called it off again last night
But this time, i'm telling you i'm telling you

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends
Talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it screaming that i'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

You called me up again tonight
But this time, i'm telling you i'm telling you


We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends
Talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together

I used to think that we were forever ever
And i used to say never say never

We are never ever ever getting back together
We are never ever ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends
Talk to my friends
Talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever getting back together"

You Need To Calm Down Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're taking shots at me like it's Patron
And I'm just like damn, it's 7am
Say it on the street, that's a knockout
But you say it in a tweet, that's a copout
And I'm just like hey, you okay?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't trying to mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson
That stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones, so

[Chorus]
(Ooooh) Ooooh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like
(Ooooh) Ooooh
You need to just stop (You need to just stop)
Like can you just not
Step on my gown
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're coming at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD?
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Making that sign must've taken all night (Aaaah)


[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
(Ooooh) Ooooh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like
(Ooooh) Ooooh
You need to just stop (You need to just stop)
Like can you just not
Step on his gown
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the Internet
Comparin' all the girls who are killin' it
We figured you out
We all know now, we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
You need to calm down
You're being too loud
And I'm just like
(Ooooh) Ooooh
You need to just stop (You need to just stop)
Like can you just not
Step on our gowns
You need to calm down"

Mean Lyrics
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I’m nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I’m wounded
You, pickin’ on the weaker man
Well you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don’t know, what you don’t know
Someday, I’ll be living in a big old city
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I’ll be big enough so you can’t hit me
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your walk by lies and your humiliation
You, have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don’t already see them
I walk with my head down
Trying to block you out 'cause I’ll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can’t lead me down that road
And you don’t know, what you don’t know
Someday, I’ll be, living in a big old city
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I’ll be big enough so you can’t hit me
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion but
Nobody’s listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumbling on about how I can’t sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean
But someday, I’ll be, living in a big old city
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean. Yeah
Someday, I’ll be big enough so you can’t hit me
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so ?
Someday, I’ll be, living in a big old city
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean. Yeah
Someday, I’ll be big enough so you can’t hit me
And all you’re ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"

I Almost Do Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
And I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I bet sometimes you wonder about me

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I just wanna run to you
And I hope that you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do

[Verse 2]
I bet you think I've either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
And I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you
And risk another goodbye

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I just wanna run to you
And I hope that you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do
I almost do


[Bridge]
We made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do

[Chorus]
And I just want to tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I just wanna run to you
And I hope that you know that
Every time I don’t
I almost do, I almost do, ooh
I almost do

[Outro]
I bet this time of night, you’re still up
I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
And I bet you’re sitting in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city
And I hope sometimes you wonder about me"

happiness (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Honey, when I'm above the trees

I see this for what it is
But now I'm right down
 in it, all the years I've given
Are just things we're dividin' up

Showed you all of my hiding spots

I was dancing when the music stopped

And in the disbelief, I can't face reinvention

I haven't met the new me yet


[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness


[Post-Chorus]
Past the blood and bruise
Past the curses and cries
Beyond the terror in the nightfall
Haunted by the look in my eyes
That would've loved you for a lifetime
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Verse 2]
Tell me, when did your winning smile
Begin to look like a smirk?
When did all our lessons start to look like weapons
Pointed at my deepest hurt?
I hope she'll be a beautiful fool
Who takes my spot next to you
No, I didn't mean that
Sorry, I can't see facts through all of my fury
You haven't met the new me yet


[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after me
But there was happiness because of me
Both of these things, I believe
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
And there is happiness

[Bridge]
I can't make it go away by making you a villain
I guess it's the price I paid for seven years in Heaven
And I pulled your body into mine
Every long, cold night, now I get fake niceties
No one teaches you what to do
When a good man hurts you
And you know you hurt him too

[Verse 3]
Honey, when I'm above the trees
I see it for what it is
But now my eyes leak acid rain on the pillow where you used to lay your head
After giving you the best I had
Tell me what to give after that
All you want from me now is the green light of forgiveness
You haven't met the new me yet
And I think she'll give you that


[Chorus]
There'll be happiness after you
But there was happiness because of you too
Both of these things can be true
There is happiness

[Post-Chorus]
In our history, across our great divide
There is a glorious sunrise
Dappled with the flickers of light
From the dress I wore at midnight, leave it all behind
Oh, leave it all behind
Leave it all behind
And there is happiness"

tolerate it (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I sit and watch you readin' with your head low
I wake and watch you breathin' with your eyes closed
I sit and watch you
I notice everything you do or don't do
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy sh-
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Verse 2]
I greet you with a battle hero's welcome
I take your indiscretions all in good fun
I sit and listen
I polish plates until they gleam and glisten
You're so much older and wiser, and I

[Chorus]
I wait by the door like I'm just a kid
Use my best colors for your portrait
Lay the table with the fancy sh-
And watch you tolerate it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it


[Bridge]
While you were out buildin' other worlds, where was I?
Where's that man who'd throw blankets over my barbed wire?
I made you my temple, my mural, my sky
Now I'm beggin' for footnotes in the story of your life
Drawin' hearts in the byline
Always takin' up too much space or time
You assume I'm fine, but what would you do if I (I)

[Chorus]
Break free and leave us in ruins?
Took this dagger in me and removed it
Gain the weight of you, then lose it
Believe me, I could do it
If it's all in my head, tell me now
Tell me I've got it wrong somehow
I know my love should be celebrated
But you tolerate it

[Outro]
I sit and watch you"

Wonderland Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Flashing lights and we, took a wrong turn and we
Fell down the rabbit hole
You held on tight to me
'Cause nothing's as it seems
Spinning out of control
Didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Haven't you heard what becomes of curious minds
Didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
I should've slept with one eye opened at night

[Chorus]
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland
In wonderland
In wonderland
In wonderland

[Verse 2]
So we went on our way
Too in love to think straight
All alone or so it seemed
No strangers watching
And whispers turned to talking
And talking turned to screams
Oh, didn't they tell us don't rush into things
Didn't you flash your green eyes at me
Didn't you call my fears with the treacherous cat's smile
Ooh didn't it all seem new and exciting
I felt your arms twisting around me
It's all fun and games, still somebody loses their mind


[Chorus]
Oh darling, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And life was never worse but never better, eh
In wonderland
In wonderland
In wonderland
In wonderland

[Bridge]
I reach for you
But you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for something else
To make you feel like what we had
And in the end in wonderland we both went mad

[Chorus]
Oh, we found wonderland
You and I got lost in it
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (Last forever)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Got lost in it)
And life was never worse but never better, eh (Never better)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Wonderland)
And we pretended it could last forever, eh (In wonderland)
We found wonderland
You and I got lost in it (Wonderland)
And life was never worse but never better
In wonderland"

I Did Something Bad Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I never trust a narcissist, but they love me
So I play 'em like a violin
And I make it look oh-so-easy
'Cause for every lie I tell them, they tell me three
This is how the world works
Now all he thinks about is me

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I can feel the flames on my skin
Crimson red paint on my lips
If a man talks shit, then I owe him nothing
I don't regret it one bit, 'cause he had it coming

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Post-Chorus]
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da
Da-da da-da


[Verse 2]
I never trust a playboy, but they love me
So I fly 'em all around the world
And I let them think they saved me
They never see it comin', what I do next
This is how the world works
You gotta leave before you get left

[Pre-Chorus 2]
I can feel the flames on my skin
He says, ""Don't throw away a good thing""
But if he drops my name, then I owe him nothin'
And if he spends my change, then he had it comin'

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad (Oh)
Then why's it feel so good?
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so good?
Most fun I ever had
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good, good

[Post-Chorus]
Ra-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-di-da-da

[Bridge]
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
They got their pitchforks and proof, their receipts and reasons
They're burning all the witches even if you aren't one
So light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)
Light me up, go ahead and light me up (Light me up)
Light me up (Light me up), light me up (Light me up)
Light me up (Light me up), light me up

[Chorus]
They say I did something bad (Oh)
Then why's it feel so good? (So good)
They say I did something bad
But why's it feel so (Good) good?
Most fun I ever had (Most fun I ever had)
And I'd do it over and over and over again if I could
It just felt so good (Good), good

Da-da da-da

Oh, you say I did something bad

Why's it feel so good, good?
So bad, why's it feel so good?
Why's it feel, why's it feel so good? (Bad)
It just felt so good, good"

Fifteen (Commentary) Lyrics
[Becca]
Thanks for listening to Big Machine radio as we celebrate the tenth anniversary of Taylor Swift's Fearless album, and perhaps one of the most poignant songs on this album and I think one that affected so many young people is Fifteen

[Taylor Swift]
Its a song that I wrote about my freshman year of high school and that was one of the most life-changing years for me because I hadn't had my first boyfriend and that I had all these experiences like I met my best friend
We met in English class in our frеshman year of high school on the first day, and um, it just really kind of chroniclеs exactly what happened that year, and how we both kind of grew up in different ways
I grew up when I realised that I didn't really wanna spend as much time with my boyfriend, I wanted to go be writing songs and going on the road and trying to be a singer
She grew up because her heart absolutely got broken into pieces, and its like that song, I'm just really glad that I was able to put those feelings in that story into words; and its really, its an emotional song for me I kinda- I broke down while I was singing the last chorus on the record, you can kinda hear it in my voice that I'm really, really, shaking up"

Lover Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
This is our place, and we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever and, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, and we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever and, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover


[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever and, ah
Take me out, take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"

Begin Again Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels, but I do
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song, but I do, I do
Walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is, but I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again

[Verse 2]
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you, but I do
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm coming off a little shy, but I do, I do

[Chorus]
And you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again


[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past

[Chorus]
'Cause you throw your head back laughing like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinking all love ever does is break, and burn, and end
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again
But on a Wednesday in a café, I watched it begin again"

The Perpetrator* Lyrics
Lyrics from Lover Journal

You're the person
Reason why others call others when they're hurtin'
You're the burden, ignored all of his shortcomings
Ripped my soul out, and wore it on your sleeve
And you did it all effortlessly

Knowing you, you wouldn't pick up the phone later
And knowing you, you'd be the perpetrator
You'd be the cause of all my problems
And you'd leave me there to solve them
And knowing you, you'd renew your place in my life
And knowing you, you'd exit from thе side like a prison escapеr
Just knowing you, you'd be the perpetrator"

Blank Space (Cover) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby (Yeah, she does)
And I'll write your name


[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever (Yeah, is gonna be forever)
Or it's gonna go down in flames (Hot)
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever (No)
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll just write your name that right here
I'll write your name"

Stay Stay Stay Lyrics
[Verse 1: Tuft]
I'm pretty sure we almost broke up last night
I threw my phone across the room
I was expecting some dramatic turn away
But you stayed
This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
And you walked in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said

[Chorus: Tuft]
Stay, 'cause I've been loving you for quite some time
And you think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay

[Verse 2: Lake Saint Daniel, Both]
Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all their problems out on me
But you carry my groceries and now I'm always laughing
And I love you 'cause you have given me
No choice but to

[Chorus: Both]
Stay, I've been loving you for quite some time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay


[Bridge: Both]
You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams
Just like hanging out with you, all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life

[Chorus: Both]
Stay, I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else will love me when I get mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay
Stay, I've been loving you for quite some time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay
I think that it's best if we both stay
I think that it's best if we both stay"

Oops, My Bad Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I blew things out of proportion, now you're blue
Put you in jail for something you didn't do
I pinned your hands behind your back, oh
Thought I had reason to attack, but no

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Fighting with a true love is boxing with no gloves
Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there's no us
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, and I'm to blame, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Verse 2]
It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh


[Pre-Chorus 2]
I lived like an island, punished you with silence
Went off like sirens, just crying
Why'd I have to break what I love so much?
It's on your face, don't walk away, I need to say

[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
I'm sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow

[Bridge]
Tell me that you're still mine
Tell me that we'll be just fine
Even when I lose my mind
I need to say
Tell me that it's not my fault
Tell me that I'm all you want
Even when I break your heart
I need to say


[Chorus]
Hey, it's all me, in my head
I'm the one who burned us down
But it's not what I meant
Sorry that I hurt you
I don't wanna do, I don't wanna do this to you (Ooh)
I don't wanna lose, I don't wanna lose this with you (Ooh)
I need to say, hey, it's all me, just don't go
Meet me in the afterglow"

False God Lyrics
{Intro]
Check, here we go

[Verse]
Looking for a way to fill a God-shaped hole in me
I get a little lost in the absence of belief
You're looking like heaven and you move angelically
Loving you feels vital, could you be my idol?

[Pre-Chorus]
Don't you know that praise
Was deeply ingrained
In my pre-adolescent brain

I'm looking for faith in a cynical age

And I don't know what's true
But I want something to cling to
Is that too much pressure on you?

[Chorus]
Oh we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god

We might just get away with it
The altar is your hips
Even if it's a false god


[Post-Chorus]
Still worship this
(Still worship this)
Still worship this
(Still worship this)
Still worship this
La la la la la love

Still worship this
(Still worship this)
Still worship this
(Still worship this)
Still worship this
La la la la la lovе

We'd still worship this love

[Verse]
Nihilist in search of somе salvation
Wanna feel divinely validated
Jesus Christ, I see you like a blameless
Child-superhuman combination
I don't understand you as a person
Too wrapped up in my own deconstruction
Sorry, sorry will it help if you see me self-flagellating


[Pre-Chorus]
Because shame was deeply ingrained
In my pre-adolescent brain
I'm looking for grace
In a witch hunting age

And I don't know what's true
But I want something to cling to
Is that too much pressure on you?

[Chorus]
'Cause we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god

We might just get away with it
The altar is your hips
Even if it's a false god

[Post-Chorus]
Still worship this
(Still worship this)
Still worship this
(Still worship this)
Still worship this
La la la la la love


Still worship this
(Still worship this)
Still worship this
(Still worship this)
Still worship this
La la la la la love

[Outro]
We still worship this love
We still worship this love
La la la la la love
We still worship this love
We still worship this love
La la la la la love

We still worship this love"

The 1 Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying yes instead of no
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishеs came true
It would've been you

[Verse 2]
I havе this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now


[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
Persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?

[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one"

Love Story Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
And I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""


[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

All Too Well (10 Minute Version) (Cover) Lyrics
All Too Well (10 Minute Version)
Taylor Swift

I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter
Your cheeks were turnin' red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past thinkin' your future was me


And you were tossing me the car keys
Fuck The Patriarchy keychain on the ground
We were always skippin' town
And I was thinkin' on the drive down: Any time now
He's gonna say it's love
You never called it what it was

Till we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearing, it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame
And you held my lifeless frame

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to

'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well

And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath
Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece till you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well

And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest
I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all

They say all's well that ends well
But I'm in a new hell every time
You double-cross my mind
You said if we had been closer in age
Maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?
A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel
Whose shine reflects on you
Not weepin' in a party bathroom
Some actress askin' me what happened: You
That's what happened: You

You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes
Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show
But then he watched me watch the front door all night
Willin' you to come
And he said: It's supposed to be fun
Turning twenty-one


Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again
But I'm still tryin' to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah

'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes
I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age
From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones
I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?
Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?
'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well

Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us (just between us) I remember it all too well (wind in my hair)
(I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it all too well)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it all too well)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)
(It was rare, you remember it)

(Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there)
(Down the stairs, I was there, I was there)
(Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there)"

Cruel Summer (Acoustic) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)


[Pre-Chorus 2]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
Oh, it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinning like a devil


[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, whoa oh
It's a cruel summer
With you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby coming home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"

Who knows why it's gotta be this way?
We say nothing more than we need
I say ""your place"" when we leave

The 1 (Corey’s Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
""I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit""
""Ready?""

[Verse 1]
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying, ""Yes"", instead of, ""No""
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made, mm

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And, if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
Mm


[Verse 2]
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now, yeah

[Pre-Chorus]
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone

[Chorus]
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And, if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one

[Bridge]
And I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?


[Chorus]
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one"

down bad Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Did you really hit me up
In a world I thought was love
Just to do experiments on?
Told me we were the chosen ones
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from
For a moment, I knew cosmic love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' over him
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, ""why can't I have love?""
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't havе him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

[Verse 2]
Did you brush off all my smoke?
Just to leavе me here, depressed and alone
In a field down in Georgia now
Got me screaming out ""fuck you"" now
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you
For a moment, I was heavenstruck


[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' over him (Cryin' over him)
Everything comes out, teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, ""why can't I have love?""
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (He's my favorite sin)
Fuck it if I can't have him

[Bridge]
I loved your cutie disclosures
I pulled you closer and closer
All of my unhinged exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you take me for granted?
Then leave me here safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love


[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' over him (Cryin' over him)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, ""why can't I have love?""
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
Down bad (He's my favorite sin)
Fuck it if I can't have him

[Outro]
Like I lost my twin
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad (He's my favorite sin)
Fuck it if I can't have him"

Delicate Lyrics
[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me...
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink


[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink


[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?

Eyes Open Lyrics
[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 1]
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 2]
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just got to keep your eyes open


[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

[Bridge]
Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

[Outro]
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open"

Bad Blood Lyrics
[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Causе baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to bе mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"

State of Grace Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (Never)
Be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
This love is brave and wild


[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
And I’ll never (Never)
Be the same, yeah
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

[Chorus]
And I never
Saw you coming
And I’ll never (Never)
Be the same, yeah

[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you coming
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)
And I’ll never
Be the same, yeah
(Oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-whoa-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, ooh-whoa-oh)


[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right"

The Story Of Us (International Mix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They're the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through

[Chorus]
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Post-Chorus]
Next chapter


[Verse 2]
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think, one day, I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is lookin' like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight


[Pre-Chorus]
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
'Cause we're going down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

The Middle Of The Light Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Life’s up, life’s down
That’s the song it sings
And the thunderin’
And the troubled clouds
Your love reached out
And took me in
A candle in the wind
It won’t burn out

[Pre-Chorus]
See, the time that you understand
My world is well when I hold your hand

[Chorus]
In the middle of the light
Oh, you take me there
Like an answered prayer
In the darkness of the night
In the middle of the light
Drown away our cares
With the love we share
In the river of your lifе
We’ll live in rain ‘till sun shines through
‘Causе I’m with you
I’m in the middle
Yeah, the middle of the light


[Verse 2]
Your embrace
That’s the place that I wanna go
When my world gets cold
You make it bright
And your face
That’s the place where heaven shows
It takes us both
It makes it right

[Pre-Chorus]
Since I’ve met you I understand
My world is well when I hold your hand

[Chorus]
In the middle of the light
Oh, you take me there
Like an answered prayer
In the darkness of the night
In the middle of the light
Drown away our cares
With the love we share
In the river of your life
We’ll live in rain ‘till sun shines through
‘Cause I’m with you
I’m in the middle
Yeah, the middle of the light


[Chorus]
In the middle of the light
Oh, you take me there
Like an answered prayer
In the darkness of the night
In the middle of the light
Drown away our cares
With the love we share
In the river of your life
We’ll live in rain ‘till sun shines through
‘Cause I’m with you

I’m in the middle
Yeah, the middle of the light"

The Last Time Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh

[Verse 1]
Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better

[Pre-Chorus]
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking
No past, no reasons why
Just you and me

[Chorus]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[Verse 2]
You find yourself at my door
Just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
All the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
Everything is better


[Pre-Chorus]
Right before your eyes
I'm aching
No past, nowhere to hide
Just you and me

[Chorus]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye, eye, eye

[Guitar Solo]

[Bridge]
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh

[Chorus]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye


[Chorus]
This is the last time I'm asking you this
(This is the last time I'm asking you this)
Put my name at the top of your list
(Put my name at the top of your list)
This is the last time I'm asking you why
(This is the last time I'm asking you why)
You break my heart
You break my heart

[Outro]
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this"

May 30, 2025 Statement Lyrics
Hi,

I'm trying to gather my thoughts into something coherent, but right now my mind is just a slideshow. A flashback sequence of all the times I daydreamed about, wished for, and pined away for a chance to get to tell you this news. All the times I was thiiiiiiiis close, reaching out for it, only for it to fall through. I almost stopped thinking it could ever happen, after 20 years of having the carrot dangled and then yanked away. But that's all in the past now. I've been bursting into tears of joy at random intervals ever since I found out that this is really happening. I really gеt to say these words:

All of the music I'vе ever made… now belongs… to me.

And all my music videos. All the concert films. The album art and photography. The unreleased songs. The memories. The magic. The madness. Every single era. My entire life's work.

To say this is my greatest dream come true is actually being pretty reserved about it. To my fans, you know how important this has been to me — so much so that I meticulously re-recorded and released four of my albums, calling them Taylor's Version. The passionate support you showed those albums and the success story you turned The Eras Tour
 into is why I was able to buy back my music. I can't thank you enough for helping to reunite me with this art that I have dedicated my life to, but have never owned until now.

All I've ever wanted was the opportunity to work hard enough to be able to one day purchase my music outright with no strings attached, no partnership, with full autonomy. I will be forever grateful to everyone at Shamrock Capital for being the first people to ever offer this to me. The way they've handled every interaction we've had has been honest, fair, and respectful. This was a business deal to them, but I really felt like they saw it for what it was to me: My memories and my sweat and my handwriting and my decades of dreams. I am endlessly thankful. My first tattoo might just be a huge shamrock in the middle of my forehead.

I know, I know. What about Rep TV?
 Full transparency: I haven't even re-recorded a quarter of it. The Reputation album was so specific to that time in my life, and I kept hitting a stopping point when I tried to remake it. All that defiance, that longing to be understood while feeling purposely misunderstood, that desperate hope, that shame-born snarl and mischief. To be perfectly honest, it's the one album in the first 6 that I thought couldn't be improved upon by redoing it. Not the music, or photos, or videos. So I kept putting it off. There will be a time (if you're into the idea) for the unreleased Vault tracks from that album to hatch. I've already completely re-recorded my entire debut album, and I really love how it sounds now. Those 2 albums can still have their moments to re-emerge when the time is right, if that would be something you guys would be excited about. But if it happens, it won't be from a place of sadness and longing for what I wish I could have. It will just be a celebration now.

I'm extremely heartened by the conversations this saga has reignited within my industry among artists and fans. Every time a new artist tells me they negotiated to own their master recordings in their record contract because of this fight, I'm reminded of how important it was for all of this to happen. Thank you for being curious about something that used to be thought of as too industry-centric for broad discussion. You'll never know how much it means to me that you cared. Every single bit of it counted and ended us up here.

Thanks to you and your goodwill, teamwork and encouragement, the best things that have ever been mine… finally actually are.

Elated and amazed,

Taylor"

Death By A Thousand Cuts Lyrics
[Chorus]
Saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts

[Verse 1]
I dress to kill my time, I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know""
And what once was ours is no one's now
I see you everywhere, the only thing we share
Is this small town
You said it was a great love, one for the ages
But if the story's over, why am I still writing pages?

[Chorus]
'Cause saying goodbye is death by a thousand cuts
Flashbacks waking me up
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause the morning comes and you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts


[Verse 2]
My heart, my hips, my body, my love
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
Gave up on me like I was a bad drug
Now I'm searching for signs in a haunted club
Our songs, our films, united we stand
Our country, guess it was a lawless land
Quiet my fears with the touch of your hand
Paper cut stings from our paper-thin plans
My time, my wine, my spirit, my trust
Tryna find a part of me you didn't take up
Gave you so much, but it wasn't enough
But I'll be alright, it's just a thousand cuts

[Chorus]
I get drunk, but it's not enough
'Cause you're not my baby
I look through the windows of this love
Even though we boarded them up
Chandelier's still flickering here
'Cause I can't pretend it's okay when it's not
No, it's not
It's death by a thousand cuts (You didn't touch)

[Post-Chorus]
Tryna find a part of me that you didn't touch
My body, my love, my trust (It's death by a thousand cuts)
But it wasn't enough, it wasn't enough, no, no


[Outro]
I take the long way home
I ask the traffic lights if it'll be alright
They say, ""I don't know"""

You Need To Calm Down Lyrics
[Verse 1: Rye Beaumont and Brooklyn Wyatt]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus: Andy Fowler]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus: Jack Duff and all]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2: Andy Fowler and Sonny Robertson]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad whеn you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on thе street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night


[Pre-Chorus: Rye Beaumont]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus: Jack Duff and all]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge: Rye Beaumont and Andy Fowler]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now, we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus: Jack Duff, Rye Beaumont and all]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down"

August Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of ""Are you sure?""
""Never have I ever before""

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Verse 2]
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine


[Bridge]
Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, ""Meet me behind the mall""
So much for summer love and saying ""us""
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
Mine to lose

[Chorus]
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine

[Outro]
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""
Remember when I pulled up and said ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
For the hope of it all
You weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose"

Anti-Hero Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Bad Blood Lyrics
[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars in my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!


[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Chorus]
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)
’Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"

I Forgot That You Existed Lyrics
Someone that you loved and that person breaks the relationship that you had for 9 months for returning with it’s ex is hard. After a long time that person wants to return but you need to say “I Forgot That… Read More 
How many days did I spend
Thinkin' 'bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwin'
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone

And I couldn't get away from you
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue tied
Free rent, livin' in my mind

But then something happened one magical night

I Forgot That You Existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I Forgot That You Existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate
It's just indifference
I Forgot That You

Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep starting going down, down, down
Laughed on the schoolyard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground

And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah Would've been right there front row
Even if nobody came to your show


But you showed who you are, then one magical night

I Forgot That You Existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I Forgot That You Existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate
It's just indifference
I Forgot That You

Sent me a clear message Taught me some hard lessons I just forget what they were It's all just a blur

I Forgot That You Existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I Forgot That You Existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference It isn't love, it isn't hate
It's just indifference (so yeah)"

Better Man Lyrics
[Verse 1: Lauren Duski, Brennley Brown]
I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than loving a man who didn’t know what he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic

[Pre-Chorus: Lauren Duski, Brennley Brown]
I wish it wasn't 4 AM, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run

[Chorus: Lauren Duski & Brennley Brown]
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man

[Post-Chorus: Lauren Duski, Brennley Brown]
A better man
Oh, a better man

[Bridge: Lauren Duski, Brennley Brown]
I hold onto this pride because these days, it's all I have
And I gave you my best and we both know you can't say that
You can't say that
Yeah, oh

I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
And I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man

Renegade Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
And if I would've known
How many pieces you had crumbled into
I might have let them lay

[Chorus:]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be thе first renegade to need somеbody

[Post-Chorus]
Is it insensitive for me to say
""Get your shit together so I can love you""?
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?

[Verse 2]
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
You fire off missiles 'cause you hate yourself
But do you know you're demolishing me?
And then you squeeze my hand as I'm about to leave


[Chorus]
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody

[Post-Chorus]
Is it insensitive for me to say
""Get your shit together so I can love you""?
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?

And if I would've known
How sharp the pieces were you'd crumbled into
I might've let them lay

Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody


[Outro]
To need somebody, to need somebody
To need somebody, to need
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
Is it insensitive for me to say
""Get your shit together so I can love you""?
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything?
Or do you just not want to?"

Cruel Summer (Mixed) [Sep. 2023] Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)


[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil


[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel su⁠—"

Fifteen (Pop Mix Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say ""hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Wеll, count to ten, take it in
This is life bеfore you know who you're gonna be
Fifteen

[Verse 2]
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends


[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen

[Bridge]
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried

[Chorus]
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen"

The Fate of Ophelia (Loud Luxury Remix / Extended Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
All that time
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of

[Chorus]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (I can see it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (The sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands (Your hands), your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (You've been) 'cause now ('Cause now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia


[Verse 1]
I heard you calling on the megaphone
You wanna see me all alone
As legend has it, you are quite the pyro
You light the match to watch it blow

[Pre-Chorus]
And if you'd never come for me
I might've drowned in the melancholy
I swore my loyalty to me (Me), myself (Myself), and I (I)
Right before you lit my sky up

[Chorus]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (Sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of (Ophelia)


[Outro]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (Sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been dreaming of
The fate of Ophelia"

You’re on Your Own Kid (Sped Up) - From Sprinkler Splashes to Fireplace Ashes Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodiеs
Just to learn that you never carеd

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Verse 2]
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away


[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Instrumental Break]

[Bridge]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid


[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid (Ah-ah)
Yeah, you can face this (Ah-ah)
You're on your own, kid
You always have been"

I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)

That's what they don't know, mmm-mmm

Hey, hey, hey
Just think, while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been gettin' down
To this sick beat

My ex-man brought his new bestfriend
She's like, ""Oh my God!"" But I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can dance, dance, dance
Yeah, oh, oh, oh

'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate

I Knew You Were Trouble (Live Cover) Lyrics
[Victoria]
Once upon a time
A few mistakes ago
I was in your sights
You got me alone

[All]
You found me
You found me
You found me

[James]
I guess you didn't care
And I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard
You took a step back
Without me
Without me
Without me

[Victoria]
And he's long gone
When he's next to me
And I realize
The blame is on me


[All]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in (let’s hear it)
So shame on me now
Flew mе to places I'd never been
'Til you put mе down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So, shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Victoria]
No apologies
He'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know
That he's the reason why

[Victoria and Kendall]
You're drowning
You're drowning
You're drowning

[James]
And I heard you moved on
From whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt
Is all I'll ever be
And now I see
Now I see
Now I see


[Victoria]
He was long gone
When he met me
And I realized
The joke is on me, yeah (sing it)

[All]
Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in (come on)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

[Carlos]
And the saddest fear
Comes creepin' in
That you never loved me
Or her
Or anyone
Or anything


[All]
Yeah
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in (knew it right there)
(Knew it right there) (oh)
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (knew it right there)
(Knew it right there) (Cmon everybody!)
Now I'm lyin' on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh

Oh, oh

Everything Has Changed Lyrics
[Verse]
All I knew
This morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen
Since eighteen hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like comin' homе
All I know is a simple name
And evеrything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


[Verse 2]
And all my walls
Stood tall painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel
In my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, makin' up for lost time
Takin' flight, makin' me feel like

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
And your eyes look like comin' home
All I know is a simple name
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
And you'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed


[Bridge]
Come back and tell me why
I'm feelin' like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna know you better, know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus]
All I know is we said, ""Hello""
Your eyes look like comin' home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

[Outro]
All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed"

­midnight rain Lyrics
[Verse 1]
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My girl was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke her heart 'cause she was nice
She was sunshine, I was midnight rain

[Chorus]
She wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
She wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, she stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain

[Verse 2]
It came like a postcard
Picture perfеct shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for her, it's еvery day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause she was sunshine, I was midnight rain


[Pre-Chorus]
She wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
She wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, she stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight

[Chorus]
Pain
She wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
She wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, she stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain

[Post-Chorus]
She wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
She wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, she stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain

[Outro]
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And she never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of her
Except for when these nights blur"

Florida!!! Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You can beat the heat if you beat the charges too
They said I was a cheat, I guess it must be true
And my friends all smell like weed or little babies
And this city reeks of driving myself crazy

[Pre-Chorus]
Little did you know your home's really only
A town you're just a guest in
So you work your life away just to pay
For a time-share down in Destin

[Chorus]
Florida
Is one hell of a drug
Florida
Can I use you up?

[Verse 2]
The hurricane with my name when it came
I got drunk and I dared it to wash me away
Barricaded in the bathroom with a bottle of wine
Well, me and my ghosts, we had a hell of a time
Yes, I'm haunted, but I'm feeling just fine
All my girls got their lace and their crimes
And your cheating husband disappeared, well
No one asks any questions here
So I did my best to lay to rest
All of the bodies that have ever been on my body
And in my mind, they sink into the swamp
Is that a bad thing to say in a song?


[Pre-Chorus]
Little did you know your home's really only
The town you'll get arrested
So you pack your life away just to wait out
The shitstorm back in Texas

[Chorus]
Florida
Is one hell of a drug
Florida
Can I use you up?

[Bridge]
I need to forget, so take me to Florida
I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
At least the dolls are beautiful, fuck me up, Florida
I need to forget, so take me to Florida
I've got some regrets, I'll bury them in Florida
Tell me I'm despicable, say it's unforgivable
What a crash, what a rush, fuck me up, Florida
It's one hell of a drug
It's one hell of a drug
Love left me like this and I don't want to exist
So take me to Florida


[Pre-Chorus]
Little did you know your home's really only
A town you're just a guest in (Florida)
So you work your life away just to pay
For a time-share down in Destin (Take me to Florida)
Little did you know your home's really only
The town you'll get arrested (Florida)
So you pack your life away just to wait out
The shitstorm back in Texas

But Daddy I Love Him (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best
Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want


[Verse 2]
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry
Bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall

[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay away from her""
The saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

[Chorus]
And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want


[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this gripin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice

[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down
Went to my parents and they came around
All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but, it's over


[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

[Outro]
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not
But you should see your faces
But, oh my God, you should see your faces
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
(He was chaos, he was revelry)"

The Archer Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you


[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

But Daddy I Love Bill Cosby Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I forget how the milk was spoiled
I forget if this was ever cum
I just learned these people only fuck in McDonald's
Lavernes and Shirleys in their Sunday sex
Clutching their balls, sighing ""What a fucking mess""
I just learned these people try and fuck you to the max, babe

[Pre-Chorus]
I lost my virginity to a horse..
For a simple twat to rise above it
They replaced this cat while I'm up on my knees
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm running with my thongs unchanged
Screaming ""But Daddy I love him!""
I'm fucking Bill Cosby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tеlling him to fuck behind the bushes
No, I'm not coming to my sеnses
I know he's horny but he's the one I want

[Verse 2]
Virgin boy, all my plans were laid
Tiger Woods into a short dildo
Sucking dick with chopsticks sometimes means not sucking dick at all
He was poosay, he was revelry
Bedroom cum like a remedy
Soon enough the elders had convened
Down at the city hall


[Pre-Chorus]
""Slurp cum right there""
COVID-19 protested too much
Lord knows the words we never heard
Just (Jiafei screams) and (Cupcakke moans)

[Chorus]
Now I'm running with my thongs unchanged
Screaming ""But Daddy I love him!""
I'm fucking Bill Cosby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm telling him to fuck behind the bushes
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's horny but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of this bitch moaning (Fuck you!!!)
I'll tell you something about my good sex
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these bitches dressed in sardine's clothing

[Bridge]
Last night, I met Karen, I had to beat the bitch out her cargos
2020, nxxxas still racist but it 'posed to be 'bout what the heart shows
Black and white sense of unity, we could really look like a barcode
But right now, it feel like doin' laundry, can't mix the whites with the dark clothes
So, nxxxa, I'm not convinced
This that motherfucking opulence
If not me, who toppin' this?
No, we ain't shit but the opposites
Use your motherfucking common sense
In the face, I let the llama spit
Now she talkin' 'bout, ""Let's make up""
Do I look like Rihanna, bitch?
And undo the pussy
You ain't gotta pray for cum
Me and my wild boy
And all this wild dick
(now that I can think of is the image of his hot, heavy cock being pressed against his hairy thigh)
If all you want is gay for me
Then it's just white cum
And it's just my choice
(You are a fucking kinky little gay boy, aren't you?)


[Verse 3]
Man got a man, that's what's up! (that's what's up!)
Love is love, who give a fuck? (give a fuck!)
Girl on girl, they like ""yup""
But when it's man on man they like ""yuck""
Motherfuckers need be go on with that shit
Bitch, we ain't playin' along, ain't no skits
Drag shows be so bomb and so lit
But fuck them in the ass

[Chorus]
Now I'm dancing in my thongs in the sun and
Even my daddy just fucked him
I'm his sex toy, and oh my God
You should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective
No, you can't come in my ass
I know he's horny but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now, you ain't gotta cum for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild dick
He was poosay, he was revelry
(now that I can think of is the image of his hot, heavy cock being pressed against his hairy thigh)
If all you want is gay for me
Then it's just white cum, and it's my choice
(You are a fucking kinky little gay boy, aren't you?)


[Outro]
Screaming ""But Daddy I love him!""
I'm fucking Bill Cosby
No, I'm not! But you –
Should see your faces
But oh my God you should see your faces
(He was poosay, he was revelry)
Boy on boy, girl on girl
Boy on boy, girl on girl
Boy on boy, girl on girl
Like who the fuck you like, fuck the world"

Cruel Summer Lyrics
[Verse 1: Laura Vierra]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus: Laura Vierra & Shane Gould]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus: Laura Vierra]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruеl summer with you

[Verse 2: Shane Gould, Laura Vierra]
Hang your head low in the glow of thе vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)


[Pre-Chorus: Laura Vierra & Shane Gould]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus: Laura Vierra]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge: Laura Vierra, Laura Vierra & Shane Gould]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil


[Chorus: Laura Vierra]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Outro: Laura Vierra, Laura Vierra & Shane Gould]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""

Mean Lyrics
You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You, have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like a nothing
You, with your voice like nails
On a chalk board, calling me out when I'm wounded
You, picking on the weaker man

You can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humilation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down
Try to block you out 'cause I never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again


I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know

Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big loud opinion but
Nobody's listening, washed up and ranting
About the same old bitter things

Drunk and grumbling on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic, and alone in life
And mean, and mean, and mean, and mean

But someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be living in a big old city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?"

Girl At Home Lyrics
[Intro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, oh-oh
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that (Everybody knows that)

[Verse 1]
I don't even know her
But I feel a responsibility to do what's upstanding and right
It's kinda like a code, yeah
And you've been getting closer and closer
And crossing so many lines

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
But, honey, I am no one's exception
This, I have previously learned

[Chorus]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, oh-oh
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that


[Verse 2]
I just want to make sure
You understand perfectly
You're the kind of man who makes me sad
While she waits up, you chase down the newest thing
And take for granted what you have

[Pre-Chorus]
And it would be a fine proposition
If I was a stupid girl
And, yeah, I might go with it
If I hadn't once been just like her

[Chorus]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, oh-oh
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that
I see you turn off your phone
And now you've got me alone, and I say
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Call a cab, lose my number
You're about to lose your girl
Call a cab, lose my number
Let's consider this lesson learned


[Chorus]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that, oh-oh
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
Wanna see you pick up your phone
And tell her you're coming home
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that

[Outro]
Don't look at me, you got a girl at home
And everybody knows that, everybody knows that
It would be a fine proposition
If I hadn't once been just like her"

We Were Happy (Demo 1) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We used to walk along the streets
And the porch lights were shining bright
That's when you looked the best to me
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

[Verse 2]
I do recall, a few smiles back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh

[Verse 3]
We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
Said goodbye so much harder
'Cause we were happy


[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, showed them all your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

[Bridge]
Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
Guess that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday

[Outro]
I guess that's-
Or do I push here?"

New Year’s Day Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day


[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Post-Chorus]
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you


[Outro]
Please don't ever become a stranger
(To the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Please don't ever become a stranger
(Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you)
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
(I will hold on to you)"

Anti-Hero Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees


[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Wildest Dreams Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Just in your)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
(Even if it's just in your wildest dreams)

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever
But this is getting good now


[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall, and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Just in your)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
(Even if it's just in your wildest dreams)

[Outro]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I'll bet these memories follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I'll bet these memories follow you around"

[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah (uh)
We're happy, free, confused and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah (mh)
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will bе alright if
We just keep dancing like we'rе
Twenty-two, twenty-two (Twenty-two, twenty-two)


[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh (Who's Taylor Swift, anyway? Ew)
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah
We're happy, free, confused and lonely in the best way (at the same- best way, ooh!)
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two, twenty-two
Twenty-two, twenty-two


[Verse 3]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin' (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news (Uh-uh, uh-uh)
I gotta have you
I gotta have you

I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you, said you, needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you"", we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But, we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever ever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Huh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like ""I just I mean this is exhausting, you know, like
We are never getting back together like, ever""

[Chorus]
We are never ever, ever getting back together
We are never ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never ever ever ever getting back together


[Outro]
We are not getting back together
We oh, not getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never ever, ever, ever getting back together"

Love Story (Water Under the Bridge Remix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus 1]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus 1]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while


[Pre-Chorus 2]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go"", and I said

[Chorus 2]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story baby just say ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story baby just say ""Yes""
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said


[Chorus 3]
""Marry me Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

[Outro]
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Labyrinth (Clean) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
""It only hurts this much right now""
Was what I was thinkin' the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be gettin' over you my whole life

[Pre-Chorus]
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
It can't last

[Chorus]
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?

[Verse 2]
It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile

[Pre-Chorus]
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Just like that


[Chorus]
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?"

Oh boy

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
All that time
I sat alone in my tower
You were just honing your powers
Now I can see it all (See it all)
Late one night
You dug me out of my grave and
Saved my heart from the fate of
Ophelia (Ophelia)

[Post-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Keep it one hundred on the land (Land), the sea (Sea), the sky
Pledge allegiance to your hands, your team, your vibes
Don't care where the hell you've been (Been) 'cause now (Now) you're mine
It's 'bout to be the sleepless night you've been drеaming of

Call It What You Want Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Ahh-ahh
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
Ahh-ahh
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
Ahh-ahh
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
Ahh-ahh
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
Ahh-ahh
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
Ahh-ahh
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night (ahh-ahh)


[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me (ahh-ahh)
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
""You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?""
Yeah!

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah (Call it what you want it to)
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream (Oh)
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to


(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah

I Forgot That You Existed Lyrics
[Verse 1]
How many days did I spend thinking
'Bout how you did me wrong, wrong, wrong?
Lived in the shade you were throwing
'Til all of my sunshine was gone, gone, gone
And I couldn't get away from ya
In my feelings more than Drake, so yeah
Your name on my lips, tongue-tied
Free rent, living in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
But then something happened one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Verse 2]
Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down
Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground
And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah
Would've been right there, front row
Even if nobody came to your show


[Pre-Chorus]
But you showed who you are, then one magical night

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you

[Bridge]
Sent me a clear message
Taught me some hard lessons
I just forget what they were
It's all just a blur

[Chorus]
I forgot that you existed
And I thought that it would kill me, but it didn't
And it was so nice
So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
I did, I did, I did
It isn't hate, it's just indifference
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
So, yeah"

Don’t Blame Me Lyrics
[Intro]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verse 1]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Chorus]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, ""She's gone too far this time""

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life


[Verse 2]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes (Echoes) of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Chorus]
And, baby, for you
I would (I would) fall from grace
Just to (Just to) touch your face
If you (If you) walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (Yeah, ooh)
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Bridge]
I get so high, oh
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me


[Breakdown]
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
(Usin' for the rest of my life, oh-woah-oh-oh)

[Chorus]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right, no)
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life, oh-oh
Don't blame me, love made me crazy (Oh-oh-oh)
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (You ain't doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (I'll be usin', I'll be usin')

[Outro]
I get so high, oh
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

I Knew You Were Trouble (Cover) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Matthew, Harry & Patrick]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sight, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me (1, 2, 3, 4!)
And I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Jacob]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize, the blame was on me

[Chorus: Matthew & Harry]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, flew me to placеs I've never been
'Til you put mе down, c'mon
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, flew me to places I've never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

The saddest fear comes creepin' in
That you never loved me, or her
Or anyone, or anything, yeah, yeah, yeah

Trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now, flew me to places I've never been
'Til you put me down
Ooh, now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Champagne Problems Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems


[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems


[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems"

The Man Lyrics
I would be complex
I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before
I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay
For me to do
Every conquest I had made
Would make me more of a boss to you
I’d be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

I’m so sick of running
As fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker
If I was a man
And I'm so sick of them
Coming at me again
‘Cause if I was a man
Then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

They'd say I hustled
Put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads
And question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And we would toast to me, oh, let the players play
I’d be just like Leo, in Saint-Tropez


I’m so sick of running
As fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker
If I was a man
And I’m so sick of them
Coming at me again
‘Cause if I was a man
Then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I’d be the man
I'd be the man

I'm so sick of running
As fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker
If I was a man
And I'm so sick of them
Coming at me again
‘Cause if I was a man
Then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man


Cause if I was a man
I'd be the man"

Out Of The Woods Lyrics
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good


Are we out of the woods

Looking at it now
Last December (last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (back together)
Your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided (we decided)
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinkin'

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good


Are we out of the woods

Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started cryin', baby, I did, too
But when the sun came up, I was lookin' at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat
I walked out and said, ""I'm settin' you free,""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
And when the sun came up, you were lookin' at me
Oh, you were lookin' at me
Oh, you were lookin' at me
And I, and I remember

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet
Good

Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods yet
Are we out of the woods
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
Are we in the clear yet
In the clear yet?
Good"

Delicate Lyrics
[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink


[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink


[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?"

deja vu (Live From Glastonbury (A BBC Recording)) Lyrics
Lyrics from Live Performance

[Verse 1: Olivia Rodrigo]
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends
Sayin' you're so unique, ""Glasto, will you sing this part?""

[Chorus: Crowd, Olivia Rodrigo]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? Ah
Yeah, do you get déjà vu, huh?

[Verse 2: Olivia Rodrigo]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
'Cause lеt's be honest, we kinda do sound thе same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)


[Chorus: Olivia Rodrigo]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu? Let's go!

[Bridge: Olivia Rodrigo]
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, she doesn't know
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel
It's a different girl now, but there's nothing new

[Outro: Olivia Rodrigo]
(I know you get déjà vu)
Alright, everybody on this left side, right here
I'm gonna need you guys to sing it, all of you guys, let's go
(I know you get déjà vu)
Alright, everybody on the right side, all the way back
I need every fuckin' one of you to sing it, let's go
(I know you get déjà vu)
All together, Glasto
I fuckin' love you, let me hear it
(I know you get déjà vu)
Yeah, I know you get déjà vu


[Outro]
Thank you, Glasto, I love you"

Who’s Afraid of Little Old Me? Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The who's who of ""Who's that?"" is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about ""sad""

[Pre-Chorus]
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Nothing makes me feel more alive

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
You should be

[Verse 2]
The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me you feel bad

[Pre-Chorus]
Is it a wonder I broke? Let's hear one more joke
Then we could all just laugh until I cry

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be


[Post-Chorus]
(You should be) You should be
(You should be) You should be
You should be (You should be)
You should be (You should be)
You should be

[Bridge]
So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?
Then say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me
So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singin' along

[Chorus]
So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean
""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be


[Post-Chorus]
(You should be) You should be
(You should be) You should be
'Cause you lured me (You should be)
And you hurt me (You should be)
And you taught me

[Outro]
You caged me and then you called me crazy
I am what I am 'cause you trained me
So who's afraid of me?
Who's afraid of little old me?
Who's afraid of little old me?"

Wet Vagina (Live From SoHoe) Lyrics
[Chorus]
Don't want sausage if you ain't got lunch bread
No I'm not afraid of your penis (Nah)
Baby with the head, I am a genius (Ah)
Scary movie, better have me screamin' (Ah)
Pussy warm you up if you anemic, ayy (Yeah), ayy
Give me that workout like your name J. Cole
Coughin' on that dick like I just caught a cold

[Verse 1]
You have my ass
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in my vagina
But you'll still be my pornstar
Baby, ‘cause in the dick
You can't see shiny cocks
And that's when you need me there
With you I'll always suck
Because

[Chorus]
When the dick cum, we'll cum together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your bitch
Took an oath, I'mma stick it out till the end
Now that it's squirting more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can slurp under my wet vagina
You can slurp under my wet vagina
(Gina, gina, augh, augh, augh)
Under my wet vagina
(Gina, gina, augh, augh, augh)
(augh, augh, augh)

Just trynna get you horny"

You Need To Calm Down Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You are somebody that I don't know
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patrón
And I'm just like, damn, it's 7 AM
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out
And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""

[Pre-Chorus]
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression
But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
And snakes and stones never broke my bones

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down

[Verse 2]
You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night


[Pre-Chorus]
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay

[Chorus]
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
You need to calm down

[Bridge]
And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns
You need to calm down

[Chorus]
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
You need to calm down"

Welcome To New York Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York


[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York (New soundtrack), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, the lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, so bright, they never blind me, yeah

Maroon Lyrics
[Verse 1]
When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
""How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?"" you say
""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how""
I see you every day now

[Chorus]
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

[Verse 2]
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up


[Chorus]
And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

[Bridge]
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave

[Chorus]
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon


[Outro]
So scarlet, it was maroon
So scarlet, it was maroon"

Lover Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover


[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"

Look What You Made Me Do Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


[Verse 2]
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?)
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me—)
""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
""Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!"" (Oh)

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me—
Ooh, look what you made me do

I Don’t Wanna Live Forever Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Been sitting eyes wide open behind these four walls, hoping you'd call
It's just a cruel existence like it's no point hoping at all

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Verse 2]
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodgеd a bullet or just lost the love of my lifе

[Pre-Chorus 2]
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?


[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit (fit, babe) wherever (wherever)
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

[Bridge]
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?

[Chorus]
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home

Me! Lyrics
[Intro]
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
I know that I'm a handful, baby, uh
I know I never think before I jump
And you're the kind of guy the ladies want
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there
I know that I went psycho on the phone
I never leave well enough alone
And trouble's gonna follow where I go
And there's a lot of cool chicks out there

[Pre-Chorus]
One of these things is not like the others
Like a rainbow with all of the colors
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
Baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e


[Verse 2]
I know I tend to make it about me
I know you never get just what you see
But I will never bore you, baby
And there's a lot of lame guys out there
And when we had that fight out in the rain
You ran after me and called my name
I never wanna see you walk away
And there's a lot of lame guys out there

[Pre-Chorus]
One of these things is not like the others
Livin' in winter, I am your summer
Baby doll, when it comes to a lover
I promise that you'll never find another like

[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm the only one of me
Let me keep you company
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Bridge]
No, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
Strike the band up, 1, 2, 3
I promise that you'll never find another like me
No, there ain't no I in ""team""
But you know there is a ""me""
And you can't spell ""awesome"" without ""me""
I promise that you'll never find another like


[Chorus]
Me-e-e, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

Baby, that's the fun of me
Eeh-eeh-eeh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You're the only one of you
And baby, that's the fun of you
And I promise that nobody's gonna love you like me-e-e

[Outro: Brendon Urie, Taylor Swift & Both]
No, there ain't no I in ""team"" (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh)

Blank Space Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy

[Verse 2]
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Verse 3]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

[Verse 4]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over (Over), mmm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (And you love the game)
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mmm
Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (Apple Music Home Session) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Yeah, I remember when we broke up
The first time, sayin', ""This is it, I've had enough""
'Cause, like, we hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change""
""Trust me,"" remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, 'cause
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And this time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are nevеr, ever, evеr getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever getting back together

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
And this time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever getting back together

[Bridge]
And I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""

[Chorus]
'Cause we are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever getting back together"

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple

Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight

[Pre-Chorus: Caleb & Kelsey]
To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that

[Chorus: Caleb & Kelsey]
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't lеt no one break your heart
And еven though you want to
Just try to never grow up

Don't you ever grow up"

[Verse]
I know that you like me
And it's kinda frightenin' standin' here waitin', waitin'
And I became hypnotized
By freckles and bright eyes, tongue-tied

[Chorus]
'Cause you could be the one that I love
I could be the one that you dream of
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you
You could be the one that I keep, and I
I could be the reason you can't sleep at night
A message in a bottle is all I can do
Standin' here, hopin' it gets to you"

Anti-Hero - versão em português Lyrics
[Letra de “Anti-Hero - versão em português”, com The Kira Justice & Leo0Machado]

[Verso 1]
Eu tenho essa coisa aonde eu fico mais velho, mas nunca mais sábio
Meias-noites se tornam as minhas tardes
Quando minha depressão opera no turno da madrugada, todas as pessoas
Que eu ignorei ficam paradas lá na sala

[Pré-Refrão]
Eu não deveria ficar só com os meus dispositivos
Eles vêm com preços e vícios
Eu acabo ficando em crise
(A história mais velha do mundo)
Eu acordo gritando por sonhar
Que um dia eu vou te ver indo embora
Porque você se cansou das minhas intrigas
(Pela última vez)

[Refrão]
Sou eu, oi
Eu sou o problema, sou eu
Na hora do chá, todos concordam
Eu vou encarar o Sol diretamente, mas nunca o espеlho
Deve ser еxaustivo sempre torcer pelo anti-herói

[Verso 2]
Às vezes, eu sinto que todas são umas novinhas sexies
E eu sou um monstro na colina
Grande demais para sair, lentamente cambaleando em direção à sua cidade favorita
Perfurada no coração, mas nunca morta


[Pré-Refrão]
Você ouviu falar do meu narcisismo encoberto que eu disfarço de altruísmo
Como algum tipo de parlamentar?
(A história mais velha do mundo)
Eu acordo gritando por sonhar
Que um dia eu vou te ver indo embora
E a vida vai perder todo o seu sentido
(Pela última vez)

[Refrão]
Sou eu, oi
Eu sou o problema, sou eu (Eu sou o problema, sou eu)
Na hora do chá, todos concordam
Eu vou encarar o Sol diretamente, mas nunca o espelho
Deve ser exaustivo sempre torcer pelo anti-herói

[Ponte]
Eu tenho esse sonho em que minha nora me mata pelo dinheiro
Que ela pensa que eu os deixei no testamento
A família se reúne e lê
E daí alguém grita:
""Ela está rindo da gente do inferno""

[Breakdown]
Sou eu, oi
Eu sou o problema, sou eu
Sou eu, oi
Eu sou o problema, sou eu
Sou eu, oi
Todos concordam, todos concordam


[Refrão]
Sou eu, oi (Oi)
Eu sou o problema, sou eu (Eu sou o problema, sou eu)
Na hora do chá (Hora do chá), todos concordam (Todos concordam)
Eu vou encarar o Sol diretamente, mas nunca o espelho
Deve ser exaustivo sempre torcer pelo anti-herói"

Sad Beautiful Tragic Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Long handwritten note, deep in your pocket
Words, how little they mean, when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they'll wait

[Chorus]
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Verse 2]
In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, in different cities
And time is taking its sweet time erasing you
You've got your demons
And darling, they all look like me

[Chorus]
'Cause we had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair

[Bridge]
Distance, timing, breakdown, fighting
Silence, this train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it, could you just try to listen?
Hang up, give up, and for the life of us we can't get back


[Breakdown]
A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, beautiful, tragic, beautiful

[Chorus]
What we had, a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"

I’m Only Wet When I’m With You Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Friday night like I’m at the dentist
Put it so deep I can’t speak a sentence
You and I are shoving dildos in my ass
I change the thongs two times a day
It’s Niagara Falls in this pussy all day
Pussy so good I’m on a trip to the bay
Soon as he put it in papi callin’ me bae

[Pre-Chorus]
I know everything about yo dick
I don’t wanna live without yo dick

[Chorus]
I’m only hard when you’re not soft
Don’t wanna cum if you’re still licking pussy
It’s like no matter what I do
Well, you make me horny half the time
The other half I’m only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I’m only wet when I’m with you

[Verse 2]
Just a small-town bitch and twat
Living in a horny world
Trying to figure out is and isn’t wet
And I don’t try to hide my cum
Papi smack my ass like a drum
Through it all nobody smacks me like you do


[Pre-Chorus]
You know everything about my ass
You say that you can’t live without my ass

[Chorus]
I’m only hard when you’re not soft
Don’t wanna cum if you’re still licking pussy
It’s like no matter what I don’t
Well, you make me horny half the time
The other half I’m only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I’m only wet when I’m with you

[Bridge]
When I fuck anyone else
It’s hard to be myself
And only you can tell

[Chorus]
I’m only hard when you’re not soft
Don’t wanna cum if you’re still licking pussy
It’s like no matter what I don’t
Well, you make me horny half the time
The other half I’m only trying
To let you know that what I feel is true
And I’m only wet when I’m with you"

We Were Happy (Demo 2) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We used to walk along the streets
When the porch lights were shining bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

[Verse 2]
I do recall, a good while back
We snuck into the circus
You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

[Verse 3]
We used to watch the sun go down
On the boats in the water
That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy


[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy

[Bridge]
Oh, I hate those voices
Telling me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
Guess that's what these tears are for
'Cause we were happy
We were happy

[Chorus]
When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all, uh, no one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
And you were gonna marry me
And we were happy

[Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost, and I'm scared
And you're turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

[Verse 2]
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you

[Bridge]
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[Verse 3]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore

[Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard, or it's wrong
Or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day

Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you

Yeah
Yeah

[Verse 1]
Lilac jacket
The one that fits me like skin

Know my name now

You knew the price goin' in, yeah

And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can tell when somebody still wants me, come clean
Standing by the stairs
 like something's funny, bubbly
Once you fix your face, I'm goin' in

[Chorus]
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

Whether I'm gonna curse you out or
Take you back to my house, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back


[Post-Chorus]
I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
You'll find that you were never not mine
You're mine

[Verse 2]
Small talk, big love
Act like I don't care what you did
I'm a White Mercedes
That you steered straight into the ditch
Then ran and hid

And I'll tell you one thing, honey
I can take the upper hand and kiss your body
Flip the name and leave you like a dumb house party
Or I might just love you 'til the end

[Chorus]
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

Whether I'm gonna flip you off or
Pull you into the closet
I haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back


[Post-Chorus]
I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice, you'll find
That you were never not mine
You're mine

[Bridge]
I can feel it comin', hummin' in the way you move
Push the reset button, we're becoming something new
Say you got somebody, I'll say, ""I got someone too""
Even if it's handcuffed, I'm leaving here with you

Bygones will be bygone eras fadin' into gray
We broke all the pieces but still want to play the game (oh)
Told my friends, ""I hate you but I love you just the same""
Pick your poison, babe
I'm poison either way

[Chorus]
Whether I'm gonna be your wife or
Gonna smash up your bike, I
Haven't decided yet
But I'm gonna get you back

Whether you're gonna call my name or
Play my heart like a game, I
Can't get a read on you yet
But I'm gonna get you back


[Post-Chorus]
I hear the whispers in your eyes
I'll make you wanna think twice
Do you wanna be mine?
I'm gonna get you back

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Bridge]
Mmm
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (And you love the game)
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"

False God Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I'd fly to you?

[Pre-Chorus]
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I'm not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just gеt away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
Wе'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love


[Verse 2]
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we're begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you

[Pre-Chorus]
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith

[Chorus]
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah


[Outro]
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love"

Starlight Lyrics
[Chorus]
I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight
Like we’re made of starlight

[Verse 1]
I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night, out the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

[Chorus]
I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we’re made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Verse 2]
He said, ""Look at you
Worrying too much about things you can't change
You'll spend your whole life singing the blues
If you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight?
Don't you see impossible things?""


[Chorus]
I said, ""Oh, my, what a marvelous tune""
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved
The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Bridge]
Ooh, ooh, he’s talking crazy
Ooh, ooh, dancing with me
Ooh, ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach ’em how to dream
Ooh-ooh

[Chorus]
Oh, my, what a marvelous tune (Ooh-ooh)
It was the best night, never would forget how we moved (Ooh-ooh)
The whole place was dressed to the nines (Ooh-ooh)
And we were dancing, dancing
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

[Breakdown]
(Oh, my, what a marvelous tune)
Like we’re made of starlight, starlight
(It was the best night, never would forget how we moved)
Like we dream impossible dreams
(The whole place was dressed to the nines)
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
(And we were dancing, dancing)
Don't you dream impossible things?
(Like we're made of starlight, starlight)


[Outro]
Like we’re made of starlight, starlight
Like we dream impossible dreams
Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?"

Wildest Dreams Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now


[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around (Around)
(Follow you around)


[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah-ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha"

Karma (Mixed) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around

[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Mе and karma vibe like that

[Verse 2]
Spiderboy, king of thiеves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around


[Pre-Chorus]
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean

[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that

[Bridge]
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
(I'm still here, I'm still here)

[Breakdown]
'Cause karma is the thunder
Rattling your ground
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me


[Chorus]
'Cause karma is my boyfriend (Karma is my boyfriend)
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend (Weekend)
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat

Fortnight [BLOND:ISH Remix] [Mixed] Lyrics
[Verse: Taylor Swift]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic

All of this to say I hope you’re okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you’re in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight therе, we were forеver

Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you"

Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene
Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and mе, there's nothing like this
Miss Amеricana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you


[Verse 2]
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared (Ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

[Chorus]
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you


[Bridge]
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), I think you should come home
And I don't want you to (Go), I don't really wanna (Fight)
'Cause nobody's gonna (Win), just thought you should know
And I'll never let you (Go) 'cause I know this is a (Fight)
That someday we're gonna (Win)

They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl""
Oh, I just thought you should know (You should know)
It's you and me, there's nothing like this (Like this)

We're so sad, we paint the town blue (Paint it blue)

The Archer Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you

[Pre-Chorus]
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

[Verse 2]
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years

[Pre-Chorus]
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you


[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)

[Bridge]
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
I see right through me

[Pre-Chorus]
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you

[Chorus]
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
(I see right through me, I see right through me)
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)


[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""

Clean Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
You're still all over me
Like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Verse 2]
There was nothing left to do (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the butterflies turned to
Dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing


[Chorus]
Rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)

[Post-Chorus]
I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Said, I think I am finally clean
(Oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst (Oh-oh, oh-oh)
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

Everything Has Changed Lyrics
[Verse 1]
And all I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like

I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you, know you

[Chorus]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
Your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name and
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, yeah
And everything has changed


[Verse 2]
And all my walls stood tall and painted blue
But I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel like

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better, know you, know you

'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
Your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name and
Everything has changed

Is everything has changed

I'm feeling like I missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind

[Pre-Chorus]
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you

[Chorus]
'Cause all I know is we said, ""Hello""
Your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name and
Everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday, yeah
Is everything has changed

[Outro]
All I know is we said, ""Hello""
So dust off all your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain and
Everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday, yeah
Is everything has changed"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed ""space"" (what?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me, falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you, would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ever) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just- I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""


[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Outro]
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh, yeah)
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"

Gorgeous Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field bein' a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

[Pre-Chorus]
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not bein' mine

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for makin' me feel this way
But what can I say? You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talkin' to evеryone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about thе consequence
Of you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single, that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)


[Pre-Chorus]
Ocean blue eyes lookin' in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for makin' me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats (Ugh) alone
Unless you wanna come along (Oh)

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous (Gorgeous)
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? (I say) You're gorgeous


[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Turns back to sad)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (What I can't have)
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)
You're gorgeous"

Eyes Open Lyrics
[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting
Everybody's watching
Even when you're sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 1]
The tricky thing
Is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers
Just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open

[Verse 2]
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around (turn around)
Oh, they've surrounded you
It's a showdown (showdown)
And nobody comes to save you now
But you've got something they don't
Yeah you've got something they don't
You've just got to keep your eyes open


[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes

[Bridge]
Keep your feet ready
Heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked
The night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
(Keep your eyes open)
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

[Chorus]
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping

[Outro]
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open
Keep your ey-eyes open"

’tis the damn season Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me

[Chorus]
So we could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown

[Verse 2]
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown


[Bridge]
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season

[Chorus]
We could call it even
You could call me ""babe"" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown


[Outro]
It always leads to you and my hometown"

All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wife

I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)

The lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me

Lover Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make thе call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I'vе loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover


[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out, and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my

This Is Why We Can’t Have Nice Things (Commentary) Lyrics
It's been a year since Taylor Swift released her reputation album and we are takin' a look back and celebrating with you, the fans, we asked you some of your favorite moments from her reputation Tour

My name is Maddy and I'm absolutely in hope for Taylor Swift, I got to see her for the third time [?] and I got to see her [?] and [?], I was [?] and she was so close to me and, like, I'm never [?] again in my life. She's so amazing, and reputation is still amazing, like, ""Oh my god"", I just loved it so much. I just cannot wait for this next chapter and I hope one day I get to meet her, because that will be, like, the best [dream?] in my whole entire life

Well, Maddy, I hope you get to meet Taylor some day too. And I have to admit, this next song, it was one of my favorites when the album came out only because it was so funny, kinda campy and lot sassy. I'm talkin' about ""This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things""

Hi, my name is Curtis [?], I'm from Minnesota, and I will have to say, my favorite songs from Taylor Swift's reputation album would have to be ""Look What You Made Me Do"", ""Getaway Car"" and ""This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things"". Because her songs kinda helped me a lot through my life, and Taylor was pretty much tellin' us, ""Forget the haters, don't let the haters bring you down"", and that's why I loved those songs. Love listenin' and dancing to it, and my favorite moment of reputation Tour, [?], it was my first time bein' in a Taylor Swift concert, and I was so excited. And my favorite moment of Taylor Swift's reputation Tour, it would have to be [?]. I just loved to see that on stage, it was so awesome and I'm so happy I got to get a chance to see my very first concert of Taylor Swift and have that moment I'll remember for the rest of my life

My name is Jane, I'm from Texas, my favorite song from reputation album is ""I Did Something Bad"", that is one awesome song. And also, ""This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things"", that is an awesome song too. My favorite part in reputation's Stadium Tour, [?] everything. I like how Taylor Swift went back through her old songs, how she played the piano [?] and the guitar. Hope to be able to meet her some day and I'm hoping she makes music all the time because she is one of the greatest singer-songwriters of all. Thank you, and we love you, Taylor

Well, Curtis and Jane, thank you so much for taking the time to call and for bein' a part of our celebration as we looked back on the one-year anniversary of reputation. You both mentioned this is one of your favorite songs, it's one of mine, here is ""This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things"" on Big Machine Radio"

Our Thong Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was ridin' yo dick with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He’s got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my ass
I looked around, turn the VCR down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say ""Nothing, I was just thinkin' how we don't have a thong""
And hey says

[Chorus]
Our thong is the smack of my ass
Sneakin’ out late, cumming on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don't know
Our song the the way you cum
The first date, ""Man, I didn't fuck her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""hump me""
Asking God if he could change thongs again

[Verse 2]
I was walkin' up the front porch steps after evеrything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And fucked, and thrown away
Got to thе hallway, we’ll on my way to my lovin’ bed
I almost didn't notice all the dildos
And the note that said


[Chorus]
Our thong is the smack of my ass
Sneakin’ out late, cumming on your window
When we're on the phone, and you fuck real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don’t know
Our song the the way you cum
The first date, ""Man, I didn't fuck her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""hump me""
Asking God if he could change thongs again

[Post-Chorus]
La-da-da-da

[Bridge]
I've watched every porn, fucked to the VCR
Waited for something to come along
That was as wet as our thong

[Chorus]
'Cause our thong is the smack of my ass
Sneakin' out late, cumming on his window
When we're on the phone, and he fucks real slow
'Cause it's late, and his mama don't know
Our song the the way he cums
The first date, ""Man, I didn't fuck him, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""hump me""
Askin' God if he could change the thongs again, change the thongs again
(Come on now baby, put it in deeper)


[Outro]
I was ridin' you dick, with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a penis, and an old dildo
And I changed our thong"

Sweat and Vanilla [Poem] Lyrics
Coffee. Stretch. Piano Keys.
Vocal warm ups in a locker room shower.
Eyelash glue. A photo of him on the mirror.
Sweat and vanilla perfume
The cracking of joints
and the distant beat of a drum.
The curtain call.
The monotonous Thrill of it all.
Plan it out so it doesn't look planned
10 different backup plans
If your red bottomed heel breaks
you will keep strutting
Balancing on the balls of your blistered feet
Know your exits. Shoulders back. Eyes up.
Hit your marks. Your winks. Sparks.
Tell them a story like it's an intimate dinner party
The looks on their wondrous faces
Their expressions like mood rings
Isn't it all so majestic?
Of course it is
It's a lot of other things too"

London Boy Lyrics
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But something happened, I heard him laughing
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say home is where the heart is
But that's not where mine lives
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our еyes meet, darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, mеt all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you (ooh)
And now I love high tea, stories from uni, and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watching rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babe, don't threaten me with a good time
They say home is where the heart is
But God, I love the English
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet, darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you (wanna be with you)
Wanna be with you (oh)
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walking SoHo, drinking in the afternoon (yeah)
He likes my American smile
Like a child when our eyes meet, darling, I fancy you (you)

So I guess all the rumors are true (yeah)

The Lucky One Lyrics
[Verse 1]
New to town with a made up name
In the angel's city, chasing fortune and fame
The camera flashin' make it look like a dream
You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool
And overnight, you look like a sixties queen

[Pre-Chorus 1]
Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-whoa, oh

[Verse 2]
Now, it’s big black cars and Riviera views
And your lover in the foyer doesn’t even know you
And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you’re lucky, but you’re so confused
'Cause you don’t feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place


[Pre-Chorus 2]
Another name goes up in lights
You wonder if you’ll make it out alive

[Chorus 1]
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you’re the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-whoa, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-whoa

[Guitar Solo]

[Verse 3]
It was a few years later, you showed up here
And they still tell the legend, how you disappeared
You took your money and your dignity, and got the hell out
They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
It took some time, but I understand it now

[Chorus 2]
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, they’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one
Yeah, I’ll tell you now, you’re the lucky one, oh, oh, oh

Holy Ground Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
That was the first day

[Chorus]
Darling, it was good
Never looking down
Right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
I see your face in every crowd


[Chorus]
Darling, it was good
Never looking down
Right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Bridge]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

[Chorus]
It was good
Never looking down
Right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Outro]
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance"

I Knew You Were Trouble Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights and you got me alone
You found me
I guess you didn't care, and I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me

[Pre-Chorus]
He's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

[Post-Chorus]
Trouble
Trouble


[Verse 2]
No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretend he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning (You're drowning)
And I heard that you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see (Now I see)

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

Trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything

Lavender Haze Lyrics
[Intro]
Meet me at midnight

[Verse 1]
Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
My melancholia

[Pre-Chorus]
I been under scrutiny (Yeah, oh, yeah)
You handle it beautifully (Yeah, oh, yeah)
All this shit is new to me (Yeah, oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creeping up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

[Verse 2]
All they keep asking me (All they keep asking me)
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
Thе only kinda girl they see (Only kinda girl they see)
Is a one-night or a wifе


[Pre-Chorus]
I find it dizzying (Yeah, oh, yeah)
They're bringing up my history (Yeah, oh, yeah)
But you weren't even listening (Yeah, oh, yeah)

[Chorus]
I feel the lavender haze creepin' up on me
Surreal
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
No deal
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze

[Post-Chorus]
That lavender haze

[Bridge]
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk (Get it off my desk)
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk


[Chorus]
I feel (I feel), the lavender haze creeping up on me

Fortnight (Mixed) Lyrics
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

[Outro: Post Malone, Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you"

Red Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Loving him is like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
When you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody that you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like
Realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as
Easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like
Trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like
Wishing you never found out about love at all


[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody that you never met
But loving him was red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody that you never met
'Cause loving him was red"

I Can See You (Logan’s Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh-oh, oh, oh

[Verse 1]
You brush past me in the hallway
And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?
I've been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it

[Pre-Chorus]
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?

[Chorus]
'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh

[Verse 2]
And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet
You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven't happened yet


[Pre-Chorus]
But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?

[Chorus]
'Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh, oh, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh

[Bridge]
I can see you in your dress and your blue eyes
Passed me a note sayin', ""Meet me tonight""
Then we kiss and you know I won't ever tell, yeah
And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission
Hide away and I will start behaving myself

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh


[Chorus]
I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew, oh
That I could see you throw your jacket on the floor
I could see you, make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you, oh, I can see you

[Outro]
Oh, I see you, I see you, baby
I see you
I see you, I see you, baby
Oh, baby"

Treacherous Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
But you're quicksand

[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it

[Verse 2]
I can't decide if it's a choice
Getting swept away
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
But you're friction


[Chorus]
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I, I, I like it

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

[Chorus]
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
And I-I-I, I-I-I, I-I-I

[Bridge]
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home

Nothing New Lyrics
[Verse 1]
They tell you while you're young
""Girls, go out and have your fun""
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, ""She looks like she's been through it""

[Pre-Chorus]
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?

[Chorus]
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?

[Verse 2]
How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?


[Pre-Chorus]
And someone else lights up the room (Ah)
People love an ingénue (Ah)

[Chorus]
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growin' up to breaking down?
And I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time movin'
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?

[Bridge]
I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh, woah, oh (Oh)
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh (Oh)

[Chorus]
I've had (I've had) too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up (Wake up) in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
Will you still want me
Will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?"

Look What You Made Me Do Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made mе do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made mе do
Look what you just made me
Oh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


[Verse 2]
I I don't don't like your kingdom keys keys
They they once belonged to me me
You you asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time (The nick of time)
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time (I do it all the time)
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined (Underlined)
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!

Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Oh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do

I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me...
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams

All You Had To Do Was Stay Lyrics
[Intro]
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)
(Hey, hey, hey)

[Verse 1]
People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed
The more I think about it now
The less I know
All I know is that you drove us
Off the road

[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)

[Post-Chorus]
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was stay


[Verse 2]
Here you are now, calling me up
But I don't know what to say
I've been pickin' up the pieces
Of the mess you made
People like you always want back
The love they pushed aside
But people like me are gone forever
When you say goodbye

[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy
All you had to do was (Stay)

[Post-Chorus]
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)
All you had to do was (Stay, stay, stay, stay, stay)

[Bridge]
Let me remind you
This was what you wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
You ended it
You were all I wanted (Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh)
But not like this
Not like this, not like this
Oh, all you had to do was


[Chorus]
(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay
Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late, well, could've been easy
All you had to do was

Had me in the palm of your hand, then
Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?
(Stay) Hey, now you say you want it back
Now that it's just too late, well, it could've been easy (All you had to do was stay)
All you had to do was (Stay)

Nereden çıktın geldin karşıma bilmem
Sensiz nerelerdeyim
Buldun ve tuttun bileğimden
Gitme kal ki ne diyeyim?

Para mülk gelir bana fasa fiso
Tek bir dileğim var o da gitme kal paso
Açtırdın koyu kuma orchids and tulips
Topladın parçaları kalbimin benims

Gözlerine bakınca gelir o müthiş
Sarı küreler gider atar güçlü bir itiş
Dindirir içimdeki kışı açar mis
Çiçekler olur bahçemdeki senin güneşinmiş

Nefesini duyan bulutlarım puf
Yandı bitti içimdeki o kalp buz
Erittin çölüme suyu sen getirdin

Lover Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up ′til January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You′re my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make thе call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I'vе loved you three summers now, honey, but I want ′em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You′re my, my, my, my lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All′s well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I′ll save you a seat, lover


[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you′re my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my

[Verse 1]
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me
I guess you didn't care, and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me

[Pre-Chorus]
And he's long gone when he's next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd nеver been
'Til you put me down, oh
I knew you wеre trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground

No apologies, he'll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he's the reason why
You're drowning, you're drowning, you're drowning
And I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see

[Pre-Chorus]
He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been

...Ready For It? Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Knew he was a killer first time that I saw him
Wondered how many girls he had loved and left haunted
But if he's a ghost, then I can be a phantom
Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever
Like a vendetta-ta

[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know

[Chorus]
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
You should see the things we do, baby, mmh
In thе middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna bе with you, so I take my time
Are you ready for it?

[Verse 2]
Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor
Every love I've known in comparison is a failure
I forget their names now, I'm so very tame now
Never be the same now, now


[Pre-Chorus]
I, I, I see how this is gon' go
Touch me and you'll never be alone
I-Island breeze and lights down low
No one has to know (No one has to know)

Exile Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I can see you standin', honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin' but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall

[Chorus]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defendin' now?
You were my town
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
Ooh, ooh, ooh

[Verse 2]
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on brеaking branches
Those eyеs add insult to injury


[Chorus]
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown
Now I'm in exile seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leavin' out the side door

[Bridge]
So step right out
There is no amount
Of cryin' I can do for you
All this time
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out (You didn't even hear me out)
You never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
All this time
I never learned to read your mind (Never learned to read my mind)
I couldn't turn things around (You never turned things around)
'Cause you never gave a warning sign (I gave so many signs)
So many signs
So many signs (You didn't even see the signs)

I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?

So I'm leaving out the side door

So step right out

I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A-Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ah
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ah
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too
You so dope, don't overdose
I'm so stoked, I need a toast
We do the most
I'm in the Ghost like I'm whippin' a boat
I got a reputation girl, that don't precede me
I'm one call away, whenever you need me
I'm in a G5
Come to the A side
I got a bad boy persona that's what they like
You love it
I love it too 'cause you my type
You hold me down and I protect you with my life
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just anther ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinkin' on a beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say (I know what they all say)
But I ain't tryna play
I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
Knew her when I was young
Reconnected when we were little bit older
Both sprung, I got issues and chips on both of my shoulders
Reputation precedes me, in rumors I'm knee deep
The truth is it's easier to ignore it, believe me
Even when we'd argue, we don't do it for long
And you understand the good and bad, end up in the song
For all your beautiful traits, and the way you do it with ease
For all my flaws, paranoia, and insecurities
I've made mistakes, and made some choices that's hard to deny
After the storm, something was born on the fourth of July
I've passed days without fun, this endgame is the one
With four words on the tip of my tongue, I'll never say
I don't wanna touch you (I don't wanna be)
Just anther ex-love (You don't wanna see)
I don't wanna miss you (I don't wanna miss you)
Like the other girls do
I don't wanna hurt you (I just wanna be)
Drinkin' on a beach with (You all over me)
I know what they all say
But I ain't tryna play
I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh you and me we got big reputations, ahh
And you heard about me, ooh
I got some big enemies
Big reputation, big reputation
Ooh you and me would be a big conversation, ahh
And I heard about you, ooh
You like the bad ones too
I hit you like bang
We tried to forget it, but we just couldn't
And I bury hatchets but I keep maps of where I put 'em
Reputation precedes me, they told you I'm crazy
I swear I don't love the drama, it loves me
And I can't let you go, your hand print's on my soul
It's like your eyes are liquor, it's like your body is gold
You've been calling my bluff on all my usual tricks
So here's the truth from my red lips
I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame
I wanna be your endgame
I wanna be your first string
I wanna be your A Team
I wanna be your endgame, endgame"

Blank Space (Cover) Lyrics
[Verse]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake""
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
I'll write your name
I'll write your name
I'll write your name"

Call It What You Want Lyrics
[Verse 1]
My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
'Cause

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Verse 2]
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
Hе built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All thе jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him


[Pre-Chorus]
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night

[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Bridge]
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
""You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?""
Yes (Would you run away?)


[Chorus]
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah (Call it what you want it to)
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream (Oh)
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to

[Outro]
(Call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
(Call it what you want, call it what you want, call it)
Call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to"

Lover Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'till January
This is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze
A mysterious way
About you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds
Or 20 years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
You're my, my, my, my...
Lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the livin' room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious
That everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you 3 summers now, honey
But I want them all


[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
(Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my...
Lover

[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen
Will you please stand
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my
Lover

My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well
To end up with you
Swear to be over dramatic and true to my
Lover

And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes
For me
And at every table
I'll save you a seat
Lover


[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever
Take me out
And take me home
(Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my...

Oh, you're my, my, my, my...
Darling, you're my, my, my, my...
Lover"

Speak Now Lyrics
[Intro]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Verse 1]
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family
All dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearing a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not
What you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""speak now""


[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play
A song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited
By your lovely bride-to-be

[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle
Like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""speak now""
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""speak now""


[Interlude]
Ooh, la-da-da-da, oh
(Run away now)
Ooh, ooh
(Say a single vow)

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaking hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only looking at you

[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely barging in
On a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

[Chorus 2]
So don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""speak now""
And you say
""Let's run away now
I'll meet you when
I'm out of my tux at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows
So glad you were around when they said
'Speak now'"""

I’m Only Me When I’m With You (Commentary) Lyrics
Becca: Thanks for listening to Big Machine Radio, as we reflect back. It's been twelve years since she released her self-titled debut album. And some people described it as sort of a modern sound meets tradition

Taylor Swift: That’s kind of what I tried to do. You know, I figured out at a young age that when you control what music you put out by writing it, then you get to control your own sound. And, you know, no one else can do that for you. No one else can take that sound away from you. And, um, replace it with something else. So, you know, this is thе music that I've always loved to sing and I think it's just differеnt enough to where people have been able to relate to it.

Becca: Well, I’d say the fact that people have been able to relate to her debut album is a bit of an understatement. And here comes a song that I would definitely say fell into the more modern category onn Taylor Swift's debut album. This is ""I'm Only Me When I'm With You"" on Big Machine Radio."

Delicate Lyrics
[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink


[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink


[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
'Cause I like you
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it delicate?"

[Verse 1]
I know you know
It felt just like a joke
I show, you don't
And now we're talkin'
And I know your ghost
I see her through the smoke
She'll play her show
And you'll be watchin'

[Pre-Chorus]
And if history's clear, someone always ends up in ruins
And what seemed like fate becomes ""What the hell was I doin'?""
And Babylon lovers hangin' lifetimes on a vine
Do you miss mine?

[Chorus: Abrams, Crowd]
Do you miss us, us?
Well, I felt it, you held it
Do you miss us, us?
Wonder if you regret the secret
Of us, us
Us, us, us

[Verse 2]
Well, I know you know It felt like somethin' old
It felt like somethin' holy, like souls bleedin', so
It felt like what l've known
You're twenty-nine years old
So how can you be cold when I open my home?
And if history's clear, the flames always end up in ashes
And what seemed like fate, give it ten months, you'll be past it
And Babylon lovers hangin' missed calls on the line
I gave you mine


[Chorus: Abrams, Crowd]
Do you mind us, us?
Well, I felt it, you held it
Do you miss us, us?
Wonder if you regret the secret
Of us, us
Us, us, us

[Bridge: Abrams, Crowd]
That night you were talkin' false prophets and profits
They make in the margins of poetry sonnets
You never read up on it, shame, could've learned something Robert Bly on my nightstand, gifts from you, how ironic
The curse or a miracle, hearse or an oracle
You're incomparable, fuck, it was chemical
You plus me was

[Chorus: Abrams, Crowd]
Us, us, us
Well, I felt it, you held it
Do you miss us, us?
Wonder if you regret the secret
Of us, us
Mistaken for strangers, the way it
Was, oh
The pain of, the reign of, the flame of
Us, us
The outline, well, sometimes
Do you miss us, us?
The best kind, well, sometimes
Do you miss us?

You’re Not Sorry Lyrics
[Verse 1]
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around

[Chorus]
And you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, oh no, no

[Verse 2]
Looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets and I'm tired of being last to know
And now you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

[Chorus]
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, oh no, ho


[Verse 3]
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade

[Chorus]
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry, oh no, ho
You're not sorry, oh no, ho

Oh no, ho
You're not sorry, oh no, ho"

Red Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red

[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red)
(Red, red)
But loving him was red
(Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red


[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red)
Oh, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red

[Instrumental Break]
Burning, it was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone (Whoa)
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red

[Post-Chorus]
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah, red (Red, red)
Burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red)


[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head (Red, red)
Comes back to me, burning red (Red, red)
(Red, red) Yeah, yeah
(Red, red)

[Outro]
His love was like
Driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street"

Ours Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine

[Chorus]
And you'll say
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong
And your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong
And I'll fight their doubt and give you faith
With this song for you

[Breakdown]
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored
'Cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours

[Outro]
The stakes are high, the water's rough

Wildest Dreams 2.0 Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what wе do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voicе is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now


[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around
(Follow you around)


[Breakdown]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ah)
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha"

Cowboy Like Me Lyrics
And the tennis court was covered up
With some tent-like thing
And you asked me to dance
But I said, “Dancing is a dangerous game”
Oh, I thought
This is gonna be one of those things
Now I know
I'm never gonna love again

I've got some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

Never wanted love
Just a fancy car
Now I'm waiting by the phone
Like I'm sitting in an airport bar

You had some tricks up your sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

Pеrched in the dark
Telling all thе rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it


You're a cowboy like me
Perched in the dark
Telling all the rich folks anything they wanna hear
Like it could be love
I could be the way forward
Only if they pay for it
You're a bandit like me
Eyes full of stars
Hustling for the good life, never thought I'd meet you here
It could be love
We could be the way forward
And I know I'll pay for it

And the skeletons in both our closets
Plotted hard to fuck this up
And the old men that I've swindled
Really did believe I was the one
And the ladies lunching have their stories about
When you passed through town
Oh, but that was all before I locked it down

Now you hang from my lips
Like the Gardens of Babylon
With your boots beneath my bed
Forever is the sweetest con


I've had some tricks up my sleeve
Takes one to know one
You're a cowboy like me

And I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again
I'm never gonna love again"

Looking at it now
It all seemed so simple
We were laying on your couch
I remember
They took a polaroid of us
And then discovered
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color"

Tell Me Why (Rhapsody Exclusive) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I took a chance, I took a shot
And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
And here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why

[Verse 2]
You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day
Wеll, I get so confused and frustrated
Forgеt what I'm trying to say, oh

[Chorus]
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
Makes me run for cover when you're around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why


[Bridge]
Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?

[Chorus]
Well, I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down
I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why, why
Tell me why
Oh

[Outro]
I take a step back, let you go
I told you I'm not bulletproof
Now you know"

Mr. Perfectly Fine Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Mr. ""Perfect face""
Mr. ""Here to stay""
Mr. ""Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away""
Everything was right
Mr. ""I've been waitin' for you all my life""
Mr. ""Every single day until the end, I will be by your side""

[Pre-Chorus]
But that was when I got to know Mr. ""Change of heart""
Mr. ""Leaves me all alone,"" I fall apart
It takes everything in me just to get up each day
But it's wonderful to see that you're okay

[Chorus]
Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

[Verse 2]
Mr. ""Never told me why""
Mr. ""Never had to see me cry""
Mr. ""Insincere apology so he doesn't look like the bad guy""
He goes about his day
Forgets he ever even heard my name
Well, I thought you might be different than the rest, I guess you're all the same


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I hear he's got his arm 'round a brand-new girl
I've been pickin' up my heart, he's been pickin' up her
And I never got past what you put me through
But it's wonderful to see that it never phased you

[Chorus]
Hello, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
Hello, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery since your goodbye
And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

[Verse 3]
So dignified in your well-pressed suit
So strategized, all the eyes on you
Sashay your way to your seat
It's the best seat, in the best room
Oh, he's so smug, Mr. ""Always wins""
So far above me in every sense
So far above feeling anything

[Bridge]
And it's really such a shame
It's such a shame
'Cause I was Miss ""Here to stay""
Now I'm Miss ""Gonna be alright someday""
And someday maybe you'll miss me
But by then, you'll be Mr. ""Too late""


[Chorus]
Goodbye, Mr. ""Perfectly fine""
How's your heart after breakin' mine?
Mr. ""Always at the right place at the right time,"" baby
Goodbye, Mr. ""Casually cruel""
Mr. ""Everything revolves around you""
I've been Miss Misery for the last time
And you're Mr. ""Perfectly fine""

[Outro]
You're perfectly fine
Mr. ""Looked me in the eye and told me you would never go away""
You said you'd never go away"

CRUEL SUMMER Lyrics
[Intro]
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it
A bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, this feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
And it's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you


[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vеnding machine
I'm not dying
We say that we'll just scrеw it up in these trying times
We're not trying

[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, this feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
And it's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing that you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil


[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, this feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
And it's cool (Oh), that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Outro]
(Ooh) It's a cruel summer
Ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you"

Mine Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You were in college, working part-time, waiting tables
Left a small town and never looked back
I was a flight risk, with a fear of falling
Wondering why we bother with love, if it never lasts

[Pre-Chorus 1]
I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lying on the couch
The moment, I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebеl of a careless man's careful daughtеr
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Verse 2]
Flash forward, and we're taking on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes

[Pre-Chorus 2]
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes
This is what I thought about:


[Chorus]
Do you remember, we were sitting there, by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine

[Bridge]
And I remember that fight, 2:30 AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out, crying, and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then, you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone.""

[Chorus 2]
You said, ""I remember how we felt, sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine


[Outro]
Yeah, yeah
Do you believe it? (Hold on)
We're gonna make it now (Hold on)
And I can see it
Yeah, yeah
I can see it now (See it now)"

Bad Blood Lyrics
[Intro]
Get ready for bad blood

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So, take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 1]
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about thе good times
You and I


[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we'vе got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So, take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knives
So, don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So, if you're coming my way
Just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I


[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So, take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!

[Bridge]
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold

[Chorus]
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So, take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Think we can solve 'em)
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So, take a look what you've done (Look what you've done)
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!"

[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink


[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it... delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night, with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
'Cause I like you

[Pre-Chorus]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me…
Yeah, I want you...
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink


[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)

'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes I wonder when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine, all the damn time
'Cause I like you

[Chorus]
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)

Don’t Blame Me (Canciones Confinadas 5) Lyrics
{Letra de ""Don't Blame Me (Canciones Confinadas 5)"" por Zahara""

[Intro: Zahara]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Verso 1: Zahara]
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacin', I just need you

[Pre-Coro: Zahara]
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, ""She's gone too far this timе""

[Coro: Zahara]
Don't blame me, love madе me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life


[Verso 2: Mucho, Zahara]
My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby (Your baby)
Echoes (Echoes) love your name inside my mind
Halo, hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now I'm your daisy

[Pre-Coro: Mucho]
And, baby, for you
I would fall from grace
Just to touch your face
If you walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay

[Coro: Ambos]
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life (Yeah, ooh)
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right (Doin' it right)
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life

[Post-Coro: Zahara, Mucho, Ambos]
I get so high, oh
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
You're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
You're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life"

Anti-Hero (Pop Punk Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
(Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I’ll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tirеd of my scheming
(For the last time)

[Chorus]
It’s mе, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, it feels like everybody here is looking at me
Like I'm the monster they've come to kill
Seems like the things I hide from them that live behind these eyelids
I try to conceal, but they see them still


[Pre-Chorus]
I take all of these -isms, wrap them in narcissism
Dressed up nice in optimism
(A tale as old as time)
I wake up drunk from nights drinking
Hungover, stressed, overthinking
And swear that this the last weekend
(But that's a lie)

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I’m the problem, it’s me (I'm the problem, it’s me)
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
Turns out I did because [?] and I think it's funny
I'm dead and they’re unhappy still

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees


[Chorus]
It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin
Ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind
Once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright
Just before they lose it all

[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red

[Verse 2]
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted
Was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing
All the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword
And realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out
That love could be that strong


[Chorus]
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red
Burning red

[Bridge]
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
In burning red
Loving him was red

[Chorus]
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark grey, all alone
Forgetting him was like
Trying to know somebody you never met
'Cause loving him was red
Yeah, yeah, red
We're burning red


[Breakdown]
And that's why he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me, burning red
Yeah, yeah

[Outro]
His love was like driving a new Maserati
Down a dead-end street"

Champagne problems Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You booked the night train for a reason
So you could sit there in this hurt
Bustling crowds or silent sleepers
You're not sure which is worse

[Chorus]
Because I dropped your hand while dancing
Left you out there standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
My picture in your wallet
Your heart was glass, I dropped it
Champagne problems

[Verse 2]
You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating

[Chorus]
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
Champagne problems
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Champagne problems


[Bridge]
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
""This dorm was once a madhouse""
I made a joke, ""Well, it's made for me""
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
""She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head,"" they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred

[Chorus]
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
With champagne problems
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems


[Outro]
You won't remember all my
Champagne problems"

You’re Losing Me (Cover) Lyrics
You're Losing Me
Taylor Swift

You say: I don't understand, and I say: I know you don't
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember looking at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light
Now I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time

Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired, even for a phoenix
Always rising from the ashes
Mending all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow

Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymorе
For you
'Cause you're losing me

Evеry morning, I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dying?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick


And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're running down the hallway
And you know what they all say
You don't know what you got until it's gone

Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
Stop, you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore
For you
'Cause you're losing me
'Cause you're losing me
Stop (stop)
'Cause you're losing me

My heart won't start anymore (stop, 'cause you're losing me)
My heart won't start anymore (stop, 'cause you're losing me)

How long could we be a sad song?
Till we were too far gone to bring back to life?
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier

Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party (you're losing me)
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fading, thinking


Do something, babe, say something (say something)
Lose something, babe, risk something (you're losing me)
Choose something, babe, I got nothing (I got nothing)
To believe, unless you're choosing me

You're losing me
Stop (stop, stop), you're losing me
Stop (stop, stop), you're losing me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore"

You Belong With Me (Radio Mix) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm thе one who understands you
Been herе all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"

Love Story (Cover) Lyrics
[Intro]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don’t go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
You’ll be the princе and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there’s left to do is run
You’ll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It’s a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we’ll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


Oh, oh

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town

[Chorus]
And I said, ""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, 'Yes'""

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh

The Story Of Us (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I used to think one day we’d tell the story of us
How we met and how the sparks flew instantly
And people would say they’re the lucky ones
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I’m searching the room for an empty seat
Cause lately I don’t even know what page you’re on

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fall out
So many things I wish that you knew
So many walls that I can’t break through

[Chorus]
Now I’m standing alone in a crowded room
And we’re not speaking
And I’m dying to know is it killing you like it’s killing me, yeah
And I don’t know what to say since a twist of fatе when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot likе a tragedy now

[Post-Chorus]
Next chapter

[Verse 2]
How did we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling of my clothes and trying to look busy
And you’re doing your best to avoid me
I’m starting to think one day I’ll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like I should have held mine


[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, I’m scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothing?
I’d tell you I miss you but I don’t know how
Ive never heard silence quite this loud

[Chorus]
Now I’m standing alone in a crowded room
And we’re not speaking
And I’m dying to know is it killing you like it’s killing me, yeah
I don’t know what to say since a twist of fate when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

[Bridge]
This is looking like a contest of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle is your hand now
But I would lay my armor down if you said you’d rather love then fight

[Pre-Chorus]
So many things you wish that I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon

[Chorus]
Now I’m standing alone in a crowded room
And we’re not speaking
And I’m dying to know is it killing you like it’s killing me, yeah
I don’t know what to say since a twist of fate, when it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now

Paper Rings Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause I waited my whole life

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so


[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (One, two, one, two, three, four)
Ah

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Bridge]
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh-huh


[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

You're the one I want, one I want

'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve them
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin
What was shiny? Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me
Where I'm weak? Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughin' right at me

Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knife
So don't think it's in the past
These kinda wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're comin' my way, just don't

{Verse I}
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity, shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is, it was enchanting to meet you

{Verse II}
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
'Cross the room your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is, I was enchanted to meet you

{Chorus}
This night is sparkling, don't you lеt it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spеnd forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

{Verse III}
The lingering question kept me up
2 AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say, ""Hey""
It was enchanting to meet you
All I know is, I was enchanted to meet you


{Chorus}
This night is sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
That this night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

{Bridge}
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the story line ends
My thoughts will echo your name, until I see you again
These are the words I held back, as I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you
Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you

{Chorus}
This night was sparkling, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushing all the way home
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew, what I knew
That this night was flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wondering if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

Please don't be in love with someone else
Please don't have somebody waiting on you"

Holy Ground Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone and, Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Yeah, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day

[Chorus]
And darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Verse 2]
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big, wide city all to ourselves
Wе block the noise with the sound of ""I need you""
And for thе first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd


[Chorus]
'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Bridge]
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

[Chorus]
It was good
Never looking down
And right there where we stood
Was holy ground

[Outro]
Tonight I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you"

[Chorus]
And I just want to fuck you
She don’t even suck you
She’s never gonna slurp you like I want to
But you just see right through my clit like a peephole but if you only humped me
We could be a horny wet, doggystyle, daddy better make me choke
Instead of just in vagina

[Verse 2]
Therе’s sperm inside yo balls
That can’t help but cum through
Shе’s never gonna suck the dick
No matter what you do

[Pre-Chorus]
And all I can think about is how to make you think of my ass
And everything that we could fuck


[Chorus]
And I just want to fuck you
She don’t even suck you
She’s never gonna slurp you like I want to
But you just see right through my clit like a peephole but if you only humped me
We could be a horny wet, doggystyle, daddy better make me choke
Instead of just in vagina

[Bridge]
Like cum in a faded pussy
Oh we’re in vagina
Put my mouth on is like CPR
Let’s make porn and watch it on VCR

[Chorus]
I just want to fuck you, she don’t even suck you
Papi let me lick you, let me stroke you
You just see right through my clit like a peephole but if you only humped me
We could be a horny wet, doggystyle, daddy better make me choke
Instead of just in vagina

[Outro]
She can’t see the way your ass
Lights up where you squirt"

Welcome to New York Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

[Verse 2]
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York


[Bridge]
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything

[Chorus]
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York (New soundtrack), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, the lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, so bright, they never blind me, yeah

Soon You’ll Get Better Lyrics
[Verse 1: Charlie Morningstar]
The buttons of my coat were tangled in my hair
In doctor's office lighting, I didn't tell you I was scared
That was the first time we were there
Holy orange bottles, each night, I pray to you
Desperate people find faith, so now I pray to Jesus too
And I say to you

[Chorus: Charlie Morningstar & Vaggie]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to

[Verse 2: Charlie Morningstar]
I know delusion when I see it in the mirror
You like the nicer nurses, you make the best of a bad deal
I just pretend it isn't real
I'll paint the kitchen neon, I'll brighten up the sky
I know I'll never get it, there's not a day that I won't try
And I say to you

[Chorus: Charlie Morningstar & Vaggie]
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
'Cause you have to


[Bridge: Charlie Morningstar & Vaggie]
And I hate to make this all about me
But who am I supposed to talk to?
What am I supposed to do
If there's no you?

[Verse 3: Charlie Morningstar]
This won't go back to normal, if it ever was
It's been years of hoping and I keep saying it because
'Cause I have to

[Chorus: Charlie Morningstar & Vaggie]
Ooh-ah
You'll get better
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better
Ooh-ah
You'll get better soon
Ooh-ah
Soon, you'll get better

Blank Space Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain’t it funny? Rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it’s gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth thе pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tеll you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game


'Cause we're young and we’re reckless
We’ll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They’ll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

I’ll write your name
But I've got a blank space, baby

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh-oh

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream


[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

I'll write your name
But I've got a blank space, baby

[Outro]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

This is me trying Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curvе, the curve becamе a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

At least I'm trying"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
[Intro]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together

[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I lovе you""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm tеlling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever


[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
(Getting back together)

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so she calls me up and she's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""


[Chorus]
(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Outro]
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Getting back together (Yeah)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)

Beautiful Ghosts Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances
When no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory

[Chorus]
All that I wanted
Was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
At least you have something
Something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I’ll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts
And the memories werе lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts

[Bridge]
And so maybе my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it’s wild and it's free


[Chorus]
All that I wanted
Was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
Born into nothing
With them, I have something
Something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts"

Safe & Sound Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember tears streaming down your face
When I said I'll never let you go
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2]
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

Just close your eyes
You'll be alright
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound"

That’s What You Get (Live in the UK 2008) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
No, sir
Now, I don't wanna be the blame, not anymore
It's your turn
So take a seat, we're settling the final score
And why do we like to hurt so much?
I can't decide
Cause you have made it harder just to go on
And why?
All the possibilities, yeah, I was wrong
Let's sing it together!

[Chorus]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Verse 2]
I wondеr
Now, how am I supposed to feel when you're not hеre?
'Cause I burned
Every bridge I ever built when you were here
I still try
Holding onto silly things, oh, I never learn
Oh, why?
All the possibilities, I'm sure you've heard


[Chorus]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
I drowned out all my sense with the sound of its beating (Beating)
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
Now, pain, make your way to me, to me
And I'll always be just so inviting
If I, I never start to think straight
This heart will start a riot in me
Let's start, start

[Refrain]
Now, why do we like to hurt so much?
Let's go!
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh

[Chorus]
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
That's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh
Now I can't trust myself with anything but this
And that's what you get when you let your heart win
Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh


[Spoken Outro]
Thank you! Yeah... Oh, man... So look, I think this has been- you know what this is the biggest show we've played on our own. What more can you really say than that? Um, except for, thank you so much London, um, I remember the first time we came here, played with a couple bands and I don't know there was probably two-hundred kids here which is crazy enough for being our first show but I don't know that was only two years ago and now here we are, Brixton and we're gonna be here tomorrow night too any you guys coming tommorrow night?

Cold As You (Demo Version One) Lyrics
You have a way of coming easily to me
And when you take, you take the very best of me
So, I start a fight, 'cause I need to feel something
And you do what you want, 'cause I'm not what you wanted


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here, thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you


You put up walls
And paint them all a shade of grey
And I stood there, loving you
And wished them all away
And you come away with a great little story
Of a mess of a drеamer with the nervе to adore you


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Just walk away
Ain't no use defending words that you will never say
And now that I'm sitting here, thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you



You never did give a damn thing, honey
But I cried, cried for you
And I know you wouldn't have told nobody
If I died, died for you, died for you


Oh, what a shame, what a rainy ending
Given to a perfect day
Oh, every smile you fake is so condescending
Counting all the scars you made
And now that I'm sitting here, thinking it through
I've never been anywhere cold as you"

Love Story Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Post-Chorus]
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said

[Chorus]
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""

Lover Lyrics
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you 20 seconds or 20 years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close forever and ever?
And ah, take me out, and take me home (forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my

Y esperarte una vida

And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Verse 2]
You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins
In public, showed me off
Then sank in stoned oblivion
'Cause once your queen had come
You'd treat her like an also-ran
You didn't measure up
In any measure of a man


[Chorus]
And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?

[Bridge]
Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?
In fifty years, will all this be declassified?
And you'll confess why you did it, and I'll say, ""Good riddance""
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden
I would've died for your sins; instead, I just died inside
And you deserve prison, but you won't get time
You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars
You crashed my party, and your rental car
You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing

[Outro]
And in plain sight, you hid
But you are what you did
And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
The smallest man who ever lived"

All Too Well Lyrics
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now

Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days

And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
Oh, oh, oh

'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me

And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to


'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah

Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Too well

Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well

Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well"

You Belong With Me / We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
[1ª Parte: You Belong With Me]

[Verso 1: JazzB, JazzB & Thaíssa Ballut]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's goin' off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in my room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
(Quem sabe canta!)

[Pré-Refrão: JazzB & Thaíssa, Thaíssa]
She wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're lookin' for has been here the whole time

[Refrão: JazzB & Thaíssa]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Outro: JazzB & Thaíssa, JazzB, Thaíssa]
You belong with me (Ah, ah!)
Have you ever thought, just maybe (Vai!) you belong with me?
You belong with me


[2ª Parte: We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together]

[Refrão: JazzB & Thaíssa, JazzB, Thaíssa]
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
We are never, ever, ever gettin' back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever gettin' back together

[Outro: JazzB & Thaíssa, JazzB]
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Gettin' back together"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space, what?
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""
No


[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together

[Outro]
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Getting back together (Yeah)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
(Talk to me) But we are never, ever, ever, ever
Getting back together"

Anti-Hero Lyrics
I have this thing where I just say shit thinkin’ it don’t matter
Moonlight becomes my only tune
When my insistence to see myself as a credible actor
Swoons into my bad attitude

I should not be so quick to judge a hazy
Words come with prices and crazies
I’ll end up as hostage (tale as old as time)
I sober, thinkin’ and schemin’
Hopin’ I’ll react to everythin’
With duty and humility
(For the last time)

It’s me—hi—I’m the problem, it’s me
Not A—I—everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the Son and show you a mirror
We must be Apocalyptic to have so many
Anti-hеros

Sometimes I feel like еverybody is a sexy baby
And I’m the loser with no skill
Larger than Jesus, slowly slouchin’ toward your favorite city
Nailed through the wrist but never killed

Did you hear my explicit egoism I share with altruism
Like some kind of messia-husband? (Tale as old as time)
I sober, thinkin’ and schemin’
Hopin’ I’ll react to everythin’
With duty and humility
(For the last time)


It’s me—hi—I’m the problem, it’s me (I’m the Judgment, it’s me)
Not A—I—everybody agrees
I’ll stare directly at the Son and show you a mirror
We must be Apocalyptic to have so many
Anti-heros

I have this dream where Taylor and I hitch it out of here and
Straight into the art history books
The human future gathers ’round and reads it
And then someone screams out
“He just wants us to read more books!”

It’s me—hi—I’m the Judgment, it’s me
K-Pop—star—too, it’s so crazy
It’s me—hi
“Dynamite Napoleon”
“Dynamite Napoleon”

It’s me—hi (yo)—I’m the Judgment, it’s me (like K-Pop on TV)
Not A (“Box A”)—I (“B”)—everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
I’ll stare directly at the Son and show you a mirror
We must be Apocalyptic to have so many
Anti-heros"

Love Story Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes, and the flashback starts
I'm standing there on a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello,"" little did I know

[Pre-Chorus]
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all therе's left to do is run
You'll be the princе and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Verse 2]
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh


[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said

[Chorus]
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

[Bridge]
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

[Chorus]
""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you, and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""


[Outro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

State of Grace Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm walkin' fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time

[Chorus]
And I never (I never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never (Never)
Be the same

[Verse 2]
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes

[Pre-Chorus]
So you were never a saint
And I loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
Mosaic broken hearts
But this love is brave and wild


[Chorus]
And I never (Never) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Saw you comin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
And I'll never (Never) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Be the same (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)

[Bridge]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You're my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

[Chorus]
And I never (Never)
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same, oh

[Chorus]
And I never (Never) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
Saw you comin' (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
And I'll never (Never) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong)
(We learn to live with the pain)
Be the same (Mosaic broken hearts) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)
(But this love is brave and wild) (Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh)


[Outro]
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right"

august Lyrics
Salt air, and the rust on your door (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
I never needed anything more (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
Whispers of ""Are you sure?"" (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
""Never have I ever before"" (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
Your back beneath the sun (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
Wishin' I could write my name on it (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
Will you call when you're back at school? (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
I remember thinkin' I had you (For the hope of it all)

Back when we were still changin' for the better
Wanting was enough
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say you meet me behind the mall
So much for summer love and saying, ""Us""
'Cause you weren't mi—
You weren't mine to lose, no
'Cause you were never mine, never mine

(For the hope of it all)

But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up, and said, ""Get in the car""
And then canceled my plans, just in case you'd call
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
""Meet me behind the mall""


Salt air, and the rust on your door (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
I never needed anything more (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
Whispers of ""Are you sure?"" (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
""Never have I ever before"" (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
Your back beneath the sun (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)
Wishin' I could write my name on it (For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all)

'Cause you were never mine, never mine

Two Is Better Than One Lyrics
[Verse 1: Nasser & Natasia]
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
""Hey, you know, this could be something""
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing

[Chorus: Nasser & Natasia, Natasia]
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
Maybe two is better than one
There's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one

[Verse 2: Natasia, Natasia & Nasser, Nasser]
I remember every look upon your facе
The way you roll your eyes, thе way you taste
You make it hard for breathing (Ooh)
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing

[Chorus: Nasser & Natasia, Natasia]
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
Yeah


[Bridge: Nasser]
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought, hey

[Chorus: Nasser & Natasia, Natasia]
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
But I'll figure out with all that's said and done
Two is better than one
Two is better than one"

You could see the best in me
Flashback to my mistakes

Even in my worst lies
You saw the truth in me

I woke up just in time
Now I wake up by your side
Ha-ah

Say my name and everything just stops
I don't want you like a best friend

White Horse (Live from Vegas) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you

[Pre-Chorus]
Holding on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I should've known, I should've known

[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Verse 2]
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chancе
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to havе the upper hand

[Pre-Chorus]
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, well now I know


[Chorus]
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around

[Bridge]
And there you are on your knees
Begging for forgiveness, you're begging for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry

[Chorus]
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't your fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday
Who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rearview mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
It's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now

[Outro]
Try and catch me now
Try and catch me now, Oh
It's too late to catch me now"

Anti-Hero – Acoustic Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room

[Pre-Chorus]
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
For the last time

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Verse 2]
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching towards your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed


[Pre-Chorus]
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
Tale as old as time
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
For the last time

[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

[Bridge]
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""

[Breakdown]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees


[Chorus]
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Clean Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2]
There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud, but no one heard a thing


[Chorus]
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

[Post-Chorus]
I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Said I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

[Break]
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

[Chorus]
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean


[Outro]
Think I'm finally clean
Ah-ah, ah-ah
I think I'm finally clean"

You Belong with Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"

[Pre-Chorus: Taylor Swift]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Kendrick Lamar]
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em (Uh)
You made a really deep cut (Uh)
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

Cardigan Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing


[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving me your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing


[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

Better Than Revenge Lyrics
[Intro]
Penis, ow
Well, don't put your balls in my hand
Fucking record it, right now

[Verse 1]
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let’s hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and shе’s not what you think
She's an actress, Whoa-oh
She's bеtter known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa-oh
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Revenge, ha)

[Verse 2]
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I’m a trend and she’s so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and
She thinks I'm psycho ’cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
They didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
(Band t-shirts are better)


[Chorus]
She’s not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa-oh
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa-oh
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge (Ha)

[Bridge]
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word

[Breakdown]
(Blegh)

[Chorus]
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, whoa-oh (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, whoa-oh
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge


[Outro]
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause
Come on, show me how much better you are
(So much better, yeah?)
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say ""Sabotage"""

Delicate (Karaoke Version) Lyrics
[Intro]
This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Where you at?
In the black
In the back
Look at you
Color blue
We could do

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]

Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicatе


[Post-Chorus]
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?

[Verse 2]
Me and you
With a view
Like I do?
In my hair
On the stairs
Wanna share

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Chorus]
Delicate
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate


[Post-Chorus]
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?

[Bridge]
Sometimes, I wonder, when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes, when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine all the damn time

[Chorus]
('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)
Is it chill that you're in my head? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Isn't it delicate?)
(Yeah, I want you)
Is it cool that I said all that? (Isn't it?)
Is it too soon to do this yet? (Isn't it? Isn't it?)

Isn't it delicate?"

Our Song (Live from Vegas) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said


[Chorus]
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for something to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Post-Chorus]
Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah


[Outro]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

Lover - Cover Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
¿Cómo dice?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home, forever and ever
You're my, my, my, my lover


[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up the first time
Saying, ""This is it, I've had enough,"" 'cause like
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said you needed space (What?)
Then you come around again and say
""Baby, I miss you and I swear I'm gonna change, trust me""
Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Like, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight, but
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, I'm telling you

[Chorus]
We (We) are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh (Yeah)
Oh-oh-oh

[Bridge]
I used to think that we were forever, ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""
Ugh, so he calls me up and he's like, ""I still love you""
And I'm like, ""I just, I mean, this is exhausting, you know?
Like, we are never getting back together, like, ever""

[Chorus]
(No) We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever (Ooh) getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
But we are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, no)
Getting back together
We (Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, oh, oh)
Getting back together (Yeah)
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me (Talk to me)

No body, no crime Lyrics
[Intro: Angel Dust]
He did it
He did it

[Verse 1: Charlie Morningstar]
Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different and it smells like infidelity
She says, ""That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account""
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out

[Chorus: Charlie Morningstar & Angel Dust]
She says, ""I think he did it, but I just can't prove it""
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: Angel Dust]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it


[Verse 2: Charlie Morningstar]
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Garden
At her job or anywhere
He reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out 'cause

[Chorus: Charlie Morningstar & Angel Dust]
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it (He did it)
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die

[Post-Chorus: Angel Dust & Charlie Morningstar]
No, no
I think he did it
No, no
He did it

[Bridge: Charlie Morningstar & Cherri Bomb]
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me (She was with me, dude)
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy


[Chorus: Charlie Morningstar]
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it

[Outro: Charlie Morningstar & Angel Dust]
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died"

Enchanted Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you

[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you

[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spеnd forever wonderin' if you knеw
I was enchanted to meet you

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)

[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you


[Outro]
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you"

Voyage / I Knew You Were Trouble. (Mixed) Lyrics
[Chorus]
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
'Til you put me down, oh

So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now, I'm lying on the cold, hard ground

Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

Trouble, trouble, trouble (Cold, hard ground)
Oh, oh-oh
Trouble, trouble, trouble

Blank Space Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad boys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game


'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Instrumental]

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the King, baby, I'm your Queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream


[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

'Cause we're young, and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Instrumental]

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over

Tim McGraw (Rhapsody Exclusive) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night

[Pre-Chorus]
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone

[Chorus]
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my hеad on your chest
And my old faded blue jеans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Verse 2]
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back


[Pre-Chorus]
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe

[Chorus]
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me

[Bridge]
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read

[Chorus]
Is, ""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me


[Outro]
Oh, think of me, mmm
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie"""

Out Of The Woods Lyrics
[Intro]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet?

[Verse 1]
Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
I remember
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)


[Verse 2]
Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking

[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
(Are we out of the woods?)

[Bridge]
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, ""I'm setting you free""
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)
Yeah, I remember


[Chorus]
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good"

We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together (iTunes Session) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember when we broke up
Saying, ""This is it, yeah, I've had enough""
We hadn't seen each other in a month
When you said that you needed space
And then you come around again and say
""I miss you, I swear it, I'm changing, yeah, trust me""
Remember how it lasted for a day?
""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
We called it off again last night
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
We are never, ever, ever, ever

[Verse 2]
I'm really gonna miss you picking fights
And me falling for it, yelling I'm right
And you could go away and hide
With some record that's much more popular than mine, but


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
You called me up again tonight
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
This time, I'm telling you, telling you

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

[Bridge]
And I used to think that we were forever and ever
And I used to say, ""Never say never""

[Chorus]
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
We are never, ever, ever getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together
Getting back together
Getting back together
You go talk to your friends, talk to my friends, talk to me
We are never, ever, ever, ever getting back together"

Meet me at midnight

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into

Wildest Dreams Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Dancin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now


[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request it is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Dancin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha (Ha, ha)
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around


[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend (Oh, baby won't you)
Say you'll remember me (Say you'll remember me)
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again (Say you'll see me again)
Even if it's just in your (Even if it's just in your)

Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
A long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)

[Pre-Chorus]
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where this leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

[Chorus]
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we nеver go out of style, we nеver go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

[Verse 2]
So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mmm
Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mmm, yeah
I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl


[Pre-Chorus]
He says, ""What you heard is true, but I
Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""
I said, ""I've been there too a few times""

[Chorus]
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

Take me home
Just take me home

You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

This Love Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on, and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone

[Pre-Chorus]
In silent screams, in wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this

[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)

[Post-Chorus]
Oh-oh-oh
(Oh-oh-oh)

[Verse 2]
Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on
Lantern, burning
Flickеred in my mind for only you
But you were still gonе and gone, gone and gone


[Pre-Chorus]
In losin' grip, on sinking ships
You showed up just in time

[Chorus]
This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)
This love left a permanent mark
This love is glowing in the dark (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me, oh-oh-oh

(This love, oh-oh) Oh-oh-oh
(This love, oh-oh) Oh-oh-oh

You're kissing my cheek, and I watched you leave
Your smile, and my ghost, and I fell to my knees
When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need

This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead (Oh-oh-oh)
These hands had to let it go free and
This love came back to me (Oh-oh-oh)

How You Get The Girl Lyrics
[Intro]
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh

[Verse 1]
Stand there like a ghost, shakin' from the rain, rain
She'll open up the door and say, ""Are you insane-ane?""
Say, ""It's been a long six months""
And you were too afraid to tell her what you want, want

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl
And then you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl


[Verse 2]
Remind her how it used to be, be, yeah, yеah
Of pictures in frames, of kisses on cheeks, cheeks
Tеll her how you must have lost your mind, ooh
When you left her all alone and never told her why, why

[Pre-Chorus]
And that's how it works
That's how you lost the girl
And now you say

[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I would wait forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, oh
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl, yeah, yeah

[Bridge]
And you know
That I don't want you to go

[Break]
Remind me how it used to be
Pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks
And say you want me, yeah, yeah, yeah!


[Chorus]
I want you for worse or for better
I would wait forever and ever
Broke your heart, I'll put it back together
I want you forever and ever
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl
And that's how it works
That's how you get the girl, girl

[Outro]
And that's how it works
That's how you got the girl"

Illicit Affairs Lyrics
[Bridge]
And you wanna scream
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me ""kid,"" don't call me ""baby""
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else

[Outro]
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times"

Fearless Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
Oh, yeah

[Verse 2]
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you

[Chorus]
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fеarless

[Verse 3]
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this onе horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it


[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

[Bridge]
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
It's fearless
Oh, yeah

[Chorus]
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless

Oh, oh

Look What You Made Me Do - Metal Version Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, ugh

[Chorus]
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


[Verse 2]
I (I) don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast (What?!)
The world moves on, another day, another drama (Drama!)
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours

[Pre-Chorus]
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, ugh

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me do


[Bridge]
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actor starrin' in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actor starrin' in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actor starrin' in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actor starrin' in your bad dreams

Yeah, ugh!

Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do

Cardigan Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing

[Chorus]
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Verse 2]
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, thеy assume you know nothing


[Chorus]
But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving mе your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite

[Bridge]
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'

[Chorus]
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing


[Verse 3]
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back

[Refrain]
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

Our Song (Rhapsody Exclusive) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to thе hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all thе roses
And the note that said


[Chorus]
Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Post-Chorus]
Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah


[Outro]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

The man (original studio ver.) Lyrics
[Verse one]
I would be complex
I would be cool
I would have played the field to know I found someone to commit to
That would be an okay
Thing to do

They would have turned on me behind my back
And then do the things they do


[IPre-Chorus]
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha-type

When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of runnin' as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get much further if I were a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
Cause if I were a man
Yeah, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Verse two]
They'd say I'd hustled
Put in the work
Instead of shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
And what was I wearing
Or If I was rude

Could all be separated from applauding business I could do


[Pre-Chorus]
And they would toast to me, oh
Let the players play
I'd be just like Leo
In Saint-Tropez

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of runnin' as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get much further if I were a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
Cause if I were a man
Yeah, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man
I'd be the man

[Bridge]

We'd drink and we'd be poppin' bottles
To the bitches and models
And it's all good if your bad
And it's okay that I'm mad
If I was out flashin' my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They paint me out to be bad
So it's okay that I'm mad

[Chorus]
I'm so sick of runnin' as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get much further if I were a man (you know that)
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again (comin' at me again)
Cause if I were a man (if I was a man)
Yeah, then I'd be the man


[Refrain]
I'd be the man
I'd be the man (oh)
I'd be the man (yeah)
I'd be the man (I'd be the man)

If I was a man
Then I'd be the man"

Paper Rings (Slowed) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met
Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet
Now I've read all of the books beside your bed
The wine is cold
Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three
Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe

[Pre-Chorus]
Kiss me once ’cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times ’cause I waited my wholе life

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you'rе the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Verse 2]
In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too
I'm with you even if it makes me blue
Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother’s wall
Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
We wouldn’t be standing here so tall, so


[Pre-Chorus]
(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice ’cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)
Three times 'cause you waited your whole life (One, two, one, two, three, four)
Ah

[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that’s right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

[Bridge]
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you
I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays
Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh-huh


[Chorus]
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Ah-ah, darling, you're the one I want
I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and
I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
You're the one I want
In paper rings, in picture frames, in all my dreams
Oh, you're the one I want

You're the one I want, one I want
You're the one I want, one I want"

Safe and Sound (Live at the Rialto) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I remember tears streaming down your face when I said, ""I'll never let you go""
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, ""Don't leave me here alone""
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight

[Chorus]
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

[Verse 2]
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when the music's gone
Gone

Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
You'll be alright
No one can hurt you now
Come morning light
You and I'll be safe and sound

(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in brеakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruеl summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)


[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil

It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh

Fortnight Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say, I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Verse 2]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

[Chorus]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him

I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I love you, it's ruining my life

I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me

'Nother fortnight lost in America

Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean


[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Now that I'm clean
The drought was thе very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowеrs that we'd grown together died of thirst (Oh)

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
The rain came pouring down
When I was drowning, that's when I could finally breathe
And by morning
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean"

Long Live Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age

[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Verse 2]
I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world


[Chorus]
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[Bridge]
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you


[Chorus]
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"

Clean Lyrics
[Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin'
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2]
There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turnеd to dust that covered my whole room
So I punchеd a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing


[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin'
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

[Post-Chorus]
I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Said, I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst (Oh)

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin'
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean
The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin'
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean


[Outro]
Finally clean
Think I'm finally clean
Ah-ah, ah-ah
Think I'm finally clean"

Gorgeous (Karaoke Version) Lyrics
[Intro: James Reynolds]
Gorgeous

[Verse 1]
You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field bein' a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much (I hate you so much)

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face (Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for makin' me feel this way
But what can I say? You're gorgeous

[Verse 2]
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talkin' to everyone here but you (But you, but you)
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touchin' my hand in a darkened room (Dark room, dark room)
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single, that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts (Honey, it hurts)


[Pre-Chorus]
Ocean blue eyes lookin' in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious
At you for makin' me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? You're gorgeous

[Bridge]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats

[Chorus]
You're so gorgeous (Gorgeous)
I can't say anything to your face (To your face)
'Cause look at your face (Look at your face; Gorgeous)
And I'm so furious (I'm so furious)
At you for making me feel this way (Feel this way)
But what can I say? You're gorgeous


[Outro]
You make me so happy it turns back to sad (Yeah)
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have (And)
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)
You're gorgeous
You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothin' I hate more than what I can't have
You are so gorgeous, it makes me so mad (Mm)
You're gorgeous"

I Wish You Would Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It's 2 AM in your car
Windows down, you pass my street, the memories start
You say, ""It's in the past,"" you drive straight ahead
You're thinkin' that I hate you now
'Cause you still don't know what I never said

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would

[Verse 2]
It's 2 AM in my room
Headlights pass the window pane, I think of you
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you want to run and hide
Then it makes you turn right back around

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phonе like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'll nevеr forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fightin' for and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would


[Post-Chorus]
I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I
I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I
I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I

[Bridge]
You always knew how to push my buttons (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
You give me everything and nothin' (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come runnin' (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
To stand back where you stood (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
I wish you would, I wish you would (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)

[Verse 3]
2 AM, here we are
See your face, hear my voice in the dark
We're a crooked love in a straight line down
Makes you wanna run and hide
But it made us turn right back around

[Chorus]
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish you would come back
Wish I never hung up the phone like I did, I
Wish you knew that
I'll never forget you as long as I live and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would
I wish we could go back
And remember what we were fightin' for and I
Wish you knew that
I miss you too much to be mad anymore and I
Wish you were right here, right now, it's all good
I wish you would


[Outro]
You always knew how to push my buttons (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
You give me everything and nothin' (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
This mad, mad love makes you come runnin' (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
To stand back where you stood (I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)
I wish you would, I wish you would
(I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would, I wish you would)
(I, I-I-I, I, I, I wish, I wish, I)

The Water Waits For Me Lyrics
(Verse 1)
In Elsinore's cold stone, I learned to curtsy low
A daughter's silent duty, where the bitter north winds blow
My father's watchful shadow, my brother's stern decree
Said keep your heart protected, from all that may enchant thee
Then came the prince of madness, with promises untrue
I tried to follow orders, but my own love broke right through

(Chorus)
The water waits for me, a mirror dark and cold
To wash away the sorrows that my frightened mind can't hold
My garland starts to wither, the rosemary is lost
I am a gentle flower, broken by the killing frost
Oh, Prince, your words were poison, your actions were unkind
Now the river runs in silver, for the peace I cannot find

(Verse 2)
He came into my chamber, a vision pale and wild
His doublet all unbraced, a frightened, grieving child
He swore I was a nunnery, or worse than I could name
And took the gifts he gave me, and threw them to the flame
I watched my sweet affections, turn to mockery and spite
My obedience destroyed me, in the blinding, cruel sunlight

(Chorus)
The water waits for me, a mirror dark and cold
To wash away the sorrows that my frightened mind can't hold
My garland starts to wither, the rosemary is lost
I am a gentle flower, broken by the killing frost
Oh, Prince, your words were poison, your actions were unkind
Now the river runs in silver, for the peace I cannot find


(Bridge)
My father lies in silence, betrayed by all his wit
And I am left to gather, the shattered, lonely bits
I give you fennel, columbine, the rue for lasting grace
For nothing now can fix, this dark and lonely place
My robes grow heavy, weighted, with the fate I must embrace
I sing my final sorrow, above the flowing race

(Outro)
Lulled by the rushing current, the weeds a gentle bed
A willow weeps above me, a crown upon my head
Softly, softly sinking... where no harsh word can reach...
Just the murmur of the river, and the flowers of the breach
The water waits for me…"

Enchanted Lyrics
[Verse 1]
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw George's face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet George


[Verse 2]
Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet George
All I can say is I was еnchanted to meet George

[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you lеt it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet George

[Verse 3]
The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?
I wonder if its a Dyson vacuum
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you


[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet George

[Bridge]
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where you meet a Dyson vacuum
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet George
Please, don't be in love with a Dyson vacuum
Please, don't have a Dyson waitin' on you
Please, don't be in love with a Dyson vacuum
Please, don't have a Dyson waitin' on you


[Chorus]
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet George


[Outro]
Please, don't be in love with a Dyson vacuum
Please, don't have a Dyson waitin' on you"

​ttwily Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He is sensible and so incredible
And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like
I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says you look beautiful tonight
And I feel perfectly fine

[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Verse 2]
He rеspects my space
And nevеr makes me wait
And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father
He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable


[Chorus]
But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you

[Bridge]
He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all
And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated
Got away by some mistake and now

[Chorus]
I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you
Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you, oh, oh


[Outro]
And that's the way I loved you, oh, oh
Never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you"

Our Song Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song""
And he says

[Chorus]
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Verse 2]
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to thе hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all thе roses
And the note that said


[Chorus]
Our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again

[Post-Chorus]
Da-da-da-da

[Bridge]
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song

[Chorus]
'Cause our song is a slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said, ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again


[Post-Chorus]
Play it again, oh yeah
Oh-oh, yeah

[Outro]
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

Timeless Lyrics
[Chorus]
On a crowded street in 1944
And you were headed off to fight in the war
You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless"

Teardrops on My Guitar (Rhapsody Exclusive) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be

[Pre-Chorus]
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without

[Verse 2]
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me

[Pre-Chorus]
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in thе car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Verse 3]
Drew walks by me
Can he tеll that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be


[Pre-Chorus]
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause

[Chorus]
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Pre-Chorus]
So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight

[Chorus]
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do

[Outro]
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile, so he won't see"

Welcome To New York (Karaoke Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before
And it said

Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Beat forevermore

It's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls

Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything

I Know Places Lyrics
[Intro]
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I
I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I, I-I (I, I)

[Verse 1]
You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we’re out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign
Somethin' happens when everybody finds out
See the vultures circlin’, dark clouds
Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Verse 2]
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won’t hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time


[Pre-Chorus]
Just grab my hand and don’t ever drop it, my love
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

[Chorus]
Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found
And they’ll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Post-Chorus]
(I) They take their shots, but we’re bulletproof (I know places)
(Hide) And you know, for me, it's always you (I know places)
(I) In the dead of night, your eyes so green (I know places)
(Hide) And I know, for you, it's always me (I know places)

The Best Day Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I'm five years old, it’s getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home

[Chorus]
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you’re not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today

[Verse 2]
I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names

[Chorus]
I don't know who I’m going to talk to now at school
But I know I’m laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it’s going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today


[Bridge]
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you

[Verse 3]
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And Daddy’s smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world

[Chorus]
And now, I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today"

volátiles Lyrics
[Verso 1]
Y aquí vamos de nuevo
A estar separados
Todo tan complicado
Ahora fue mi culpa
Fui yo el que te hizo daño
Todo cambia con los años
Sé que probablemente no te escuché
Y cuando ya era tarde recapacité
Todo lo que dijiste en serio fue
Y entonces como un chiste me lo tomé

[Pre-coro]
No quiero que te arrepientas de cuando volviste a estar cerca
Sabés que nunca lo hice con intención
I just want you to meet me in the afterglow


[Coro]
Y aún no puedo pеdirte perdón aunque quiеra
Sigo en el camino de darme cuenta
Quisiera haber cambiado sin perderte
Pero fue mi precio a pagar por inconsciente
Cuando nos juntamos somos muy frágiles
Ojalá no fuéramos tan volátiles
Tan volátiles


[Verso 2]
Ser más que amigos pero no estar juntos
Nunca estuvo fácil
Siempre hay alguno que espera del otro cosas que de la nada no nacen
Tan solo sigo odiando que ya estemos a mano
Sé que una canción no va a arreglar el daño
Mi buzo café sigue con tu escencia
Y la cuchara de ese postre sigue en la mesa

[Pre-coro]
No sé cómo la gente lo interprete
Lo nuestro era como si tuviéramos diecisiete
I fucking wish that I was calling you
And every time I don't I almost do


[Coro]
Y aún no puedo pedirte perdón aunque quiera
Sigo en el camino de darme cuenta
Quisiera haber cambiado sin perderte
Pero fue mi precio a pagar por inconsciente
Cuando nos juntamos somos muy frágiles
Ojalá no fuéramos tan volátiles
Tan volátiles

[Coro]
Y aún no puedo pedirte perdón aunque quiera
Sigo en el camino de darme cuenta
Quisiera haber cambiado sin perderte
Pero fue mi precio a pagar por inconsciente
Cuando nos juntamos somos muy frágiles
Ojalá no fuéramos tan volátiles


[Outro: Santiago Alarcón]
Señora Ana, todavía me alcanza para una canción más
Pero yo creo que ya esta ya.. ya dijo lo que tenía que decirle"

Clean (Live from Arlington) Lyrics
Verse 1]
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst
It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore

[Pre-Chorus]
Hung my head as I lost the war
And the sky turned black like a perfect storm

[Chorus]
The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

[Verse 2]
There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room
So I punched a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you

[Pre-Chorus]
The water filled my lungs
I screamed so loud, but no one heard a thing


[Chorus]
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean

[Post-Chorus]
I think I am finally clean, ah-ah

[Bridge]
Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

[Break]
The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

[Chorus]
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean
The rain came pourin' down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe
And by mornin', gone was any trace of you
I think I am finally clean


[Outro]
I think I am finally clean"

Wildest Dreams Lyrics
[Verse 1]
She said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought heaven can't help me now
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
She's so smart and pretty as hell
She's so bad, but she does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
While standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Your red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams (ah-ah, ha)
Wildest dreams (ah-ah, ha)

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No onе has to know what we do""
Her hands are in my hair, hеr clothes are in my room
And her voice is a familiar sound
Nothing lasts forever


[Pre-Chorus]
But this is getting good now
She's so smart and pretty as hell
She's so bad, but she does it so well (so well)
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
While standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Your red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams (ah-ah, ha)
Wildest dreams (ah-ah, ha)

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around

[Breakdown]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burning it down
Someday when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around (follow you around)


[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
While standing in a nice dress
Staring at the sunset, babe
Your red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
(While standing in a nice dress)
Staring at the sunset, babe
Your red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's (just pretend, just pretend) in your wildest dreams (ah-ah, ha) (ah)
In your wildest dreams
Even if it's just in your wildest dreams (ah-ah, ha)

In your wildest dreams"

I Can Do It With A Broken Heart* Lyrics
Lyrics from original song

[Verse 1]
I can read your mind
""She's having the time of her life""
There in her glittering prime
The lights refract sequin stars off her silhouette every night
I can show you lies
(One, two, three, four)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
Even when you wanna die
He said he'd love me all his life
But that life was too short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the piеces of me shatterеd as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart


[Verse 2]
I can hold my breath
I've been doin' it since he left
I keep finding his things in drawers
Crucial evidence I didn't imagine the whole thing
I'm sure I can pass this test
(One, two, three, four)

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause I'm a real tough kid
I can handle my shit
They said, ""Babe, you gotta fake it 'til you make it"" and I did
Lights, camera, bitch, smile
In stilettos for miles
He said he'd love me for all time
But that time was quite short
Breaking down, I hit the floor
All the pieces of me shattered as the crowd was chanting, ""More""
I was grinnin' like I'm winnin'
I was hittin' my marks
'Cause I can do it with a broken heart
(One, two, three, four)

[Chorus]
I'm so depressed, I act like it's my birthday every day
I'm so obsessed with him, but he avoids me (He avoids me), like the plague
I cry a lot, but I am so productive, it's an art
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart


[Outro]
You know you're good when you can even do it with a broken heart
You know you're good
And I'm good
'Cause I'm miserable (Haha)
And nobody even knows
Ah, try and come for my job"

Last Kiss Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away

[Verse 2]
I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart
It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms

[Pre-Chorus]
But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Verse 3]
I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again
And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did
Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something
There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions


[Pre-Chorus]
And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss

[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh

[Bridge]
So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep
And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe
And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are

[Verse 4]
And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed
You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind

[Pre-Chorus]
So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes
All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss


[Chorus]
I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this
Your name, forever the name on my lips

[Outro]
Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips
Just like our last"

No, nothin' good starts in a getaway car

[Instrumental]

[Pre-Chorus]
We never had a shotgun shot in the dark (Oh)

[Chorus]
You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

In a getaway car (Oh-oh-oh)
No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)

You were drivin' the getaway car
We were flyin', but we'd never get far
Don't pretend it's such a mystery
Think about the place where you first met me
Ridin' in a getaway car
There were sirens in the beat of your heart
Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave
Think about the place where you first met me

No, they never get far (Oh-oh-ah)

Shoulda known I'd be the first to leave

fortnight (acoustic) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you’re okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you’re in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Verse 2]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an еndless February
I took the miraclе move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
(I love you, it's ruining my life)
I touched you for only a fortnight
(I touched you for only a fortnight)

[Chorus]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbours
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbours
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him


[Bridge]
I love you, it's ruining my life
(I love you, it's ruining my life)
I touched you for only a fortnight
(I touched you for only a fortnight)
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it’s ruining my life (I love you, it’s runing my life)
I touched you for only a fortnight

[Outro]
Thought of callin' ya, but you won’t pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Moved to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
Thought of calling ya, but you won’t pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Moved to Florida, buy the car you want (Florida, car you want)
But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you"

Blank Space Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" (Ay)
New money, suit, and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Pre-Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game


[Chorus]
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden, filled with thorns
Keep you second-guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream


[Pre-Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game

[Chorus]
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya


[Pre-Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (And you love the game)

[Chorus]
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"

This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

[Verse 1]
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do

Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?

[Verse 2]
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share

[Pre-Chorus]
('Cause I like you) This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
(Yeah, I want you) We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink

Is it cool that I said all that?

Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it delicate?

Sometimes, I wonder, when you sleep
Are you ever dreaming of me?
Sometimes, when I look into your eyes
I pretend you're mine all the damn time

('Cause I like you)
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate (Delicate)
(Yeah, I want you)

1 step forward, 3 steps back (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me messed up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff

[Chorus]
'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

[Verse 2]
And maybе in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lovеr will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?

[Chorus]
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand


[Bridge]
No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead

[Chorus]
It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the rollercoaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand"

Dancing with Our Hands Tied (Karaoke Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Oh, twenty-five years old
Oh, how were you to know? And
Oh, and you held me close
Oh, how was I to know? I

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feelin'
And darlin', you had turned my bed into a sacred oasis
People started talkin', puttin' us through our paces
I knew there was no one in the world who could take it
I had a bad feelin'

[Chorus]
But we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
And I had a bad feelin'
But we were dancin'


[Verse 2]
So, baby, can we dance
Oh, through an avalanche? And
Say, say that we got it
Mess, but I'm the mess that you wanted
Oh, 'cause it's gravity
Oh, keeping you with me, I

[Pre-Chorus]
Could've spent forever with your hands in my pockets
Picture of your face in an invisible locket
You said there was nothin' in the world that could stop it
I had a bad feelin'

[Chorus]
But we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
And I had a bad feelin'
But we were dancin'

[Bridge]
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swayin' as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again
I'd kiss you as the lights went out
Swayin' as the room burned down
I'd hold you as the water rushes in
If I could dance with you again


[Chorus]
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
Like it was the first time, first time
Yeah, we were dancin'
Dancin' with our hands tied, hands tied
Yeah, we were dancin'
And I had a bad feelin'
But we were dancin'

down bad x down bad Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Did you really beam me up
In a cloud of sparkling dust
Just to do experiments on?
Tell me I was the chosen one
Showed me that this world is bigger than us
Then sent me back where I came from
For a moment, I knew cosmic love

[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him""
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him
Down bad
Fuck it if I can't have him

[Verse 2]
Did you takе all my old clothes
Just to leave mе here, naked and alone
In a field in my same old town
That somehow seems so hollow now?
They'll say I'm nuts if I talk about
The existence of you
For a moment, I was heavenstruck


[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out, teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Fuck it if I can't have him)
I might just die, it would make no difference
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (Down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

[Bridge]
I loved your hostile takeovers
Encounters closer and closer
All your indecent exposures
How dare you say that it's—
I'll build you a fort on some planet
Where they can all understand it
How dare you think it's romantic
Leaving me safe and stranded
'Cause fuck it, I was in love
So fuck you if I can't have us
'Cause fuck it, I was in love


[Chorus]
Now I'm down bad, cryin' at the gym (Cryin' at the gym)
Everything comes out teenage petulance
""Fuck it if I can't have him"" (Can't have him)
""I might just die, it would make no difference""
Down bad, wakin' up in blood (Wakin' up in blood)
Starin' at the sky, come back and pick me up
Fuck it if I can't have us
I might just not get up, I might stay

[Post-Chorus]
Down bad (Like I lost my twin)
Fuck it if I can't have him (I'm down bad)
Down bad (Wavin' at the ship)
Fuck it if I can't have him

Fortnight (Remake) Lyrics
This is a remake Afrobeats mixed R&B of FORTNIGHT by Taylor Swift featuring Post Malone.
[Verse 1: Taylor Swift]
I was supposed to be sent away
But they forgot to come and get me
I was a functioning alcoholic
'Til nobody noticed my new aesthetic
All of this to say I hope you're okay
But you're the reason
And no one here's to blame
But what about your quiet treason?

[Chorus: Taylor Swift]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her

[Verse 2: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone, Post Malone]
All my mornings are Mondays stuck in an endless February
I took the miracle move-on drug, the effects were temporary
And I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, but I touched you

[Chorus: Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
And for a fortnight there, we were forever
Run into you sometimes, ask about the weather
Now you're in my backyard, turned into good neighbors
Your wife waters flowers, I wanna kill her
And for a fortnight there, we were together
Run into you sometimes, comment on my sweater
Now you're at the mailbox, turned into good neighbors
My husband is cheating, I wanna kill him


[Bridge: Taylor Swift, Post Malone, Taylor Swift & Post Malone]
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you
I love you, it's ruining my life
I love you, it's ruining my life
I touched you for only a fortnight
I touched you, I touched you

[Outro: Post Malone, Post Malone & Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift]
Thought of callin' ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til you touch, touch, touch me
Thought of calling ya, but you won't pick up
'Nother fortnight lost in America
Move to Florida, buy the car you want
But it won't start up 'til I touch, touch, touch you"

Speak Now Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry

[Pre-Chorus]
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Spеak now""

[Verse 2]
Fond gestures are еxchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be


[Pre-Chorus]
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?

[Chorus]
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""
Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""

[Post-Chorus]
Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh

[Bridge]
I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you


[Verse 3]
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha

[Chorus]
So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, ""Speak now""
And you say, ""Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"""

Taylor Swift - Long Live/New Year’s Day/The Manuscript (Live from The Eras Tour Vancouver N3) Lyrics
[Long Live: Verse 1]
I said remember this moment
In the back of my mind
We stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
It was the end of an era

But the start of an age
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
And I was screaming long live
The walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming long live, all the magic we made
Bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

[New Year's Day: Verse 1]
There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carryin' their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but

[New Year's Day: Chorus]
Don't read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you're turnin' away
I want, your midnights, But I'll be cleanin' up bottles with you on New Year's Day


[The Manuscript: Bridge]
And the years passed, like scenes of a show
The professor, said to write what you know
Lookin' backwards, might be the only way to move forward
Then the actors, were hitting their marks
And the slow dance was alight with the sparks
And the tears fell in synchronicity with the score
And at last, she knew what the agony had been for

[Long Live: Bridge]
So hold on, to spinning around
Confetti, falls to the ground
May these memories, break our fall

[New Year's Day: Bridge]
Please, don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please, don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere

[New Year's Day: Refrain]
And hold on, to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on, to the memories, they will hold on to you
Hold on, to the memories, they will hold on to you

[Long Live: Chorus]
And long live, the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined for me and you
And long, long live all the magic we made
And bring on all the pretenders
'Cause one day
We will be remembered


[The Manuscript: Outro]
The only thing that's left is the manuscript
One last souvenir from my trip to your shores
Now and then, I reread the manuscript
But the story isn't mine, anymore...

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

Did you have to do this?
Did you have to ruin?
Did you have to hit me?
Rub it in so deep

So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey

You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey


[Verse 2]
Did you think we'd be fine?
Don't think it's in the past
Did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're comin' my way, just don't

[Pre-Chorus]
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
You and I

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we've got bad blood, hey

[Bridge]
Ghosts
Band-Aids don't fix bullet holes (Hey)
You say sorry just for show (Hey)
If you live like that, you live with ghosts (Hey)


[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause, baby, now we got bad blood, hey
Now we got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And, baby, now we got bad blood, hey"

the last great american dynasty (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, ""How did a middle-class divorcée do it?""
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it ""Holiday House""
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his hеart gave out

[Chorus]
And they said
""Therе goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Verse 2]
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her- Pack friends from the city

Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí


[Chorus]
And they said
""There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything""

[Bridge]
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me

[Chorus]
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything

[Outro]
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time
I had a marvelous time"

You’re on your own, kid - Cover Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days

[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodiеs
Just to learn that you never carеd

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Verse 2]
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away


[Pre-Chorus]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

[Bridge]
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid

[Chorus]
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been"

Blank Space Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""O-o-oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?"" A-a-ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magaz-z-zine
Ain't it funny? Rumors, L-l-lies
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be f-f-friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If thе high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
Thеy'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Verse 2]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty l-l-lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, li-i-i
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want l-l-love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"

Ours (Live from Arlington) Lyrics
Verse 1]
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you

[Chorus]
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shinе
And life makes love look hard
Thе stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

[Verse 2]
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say

[Chorus]
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours


[Bridge]
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours

[Chorus]
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours"

Hands are in my hair, clothes are in my room

Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress

Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' (Burnin') it (It) down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow (Follow) you (You) around

Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again

Wildest dreams, ah, ha"

The Man (BM2025) Lyrics
I would be complex
I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay
For me to do

Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I'd be a fearless leader
I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya
What's that like?

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man

And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man
Then I'd be the man I'd be the man
I'd be the man
They'd say I hustled
Put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing
If I was rude

Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves?
And they would toast to me
Oh let the players play
I'd be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez

I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again
Cause if I was a man
Then I'd be the man I'd be the man
I'd be the man
What's it like to brag about ranking in dollars and getting bitches and models

And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was flashing my dollars I'd be a bitch
Not a baller they paint me out to be bad

So it's okay that I'm mad
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wondering if I'd get there quicker if I was a man (you know that)
And I'm so sick of them coming at me again (coming at me again) cause if I was a man (if I was a man)
Then I'd be the man I'd be the man I'd be the man (oh)
I'd be the man (yeah) I'd be the man (I'd be the man) if I was a man then I'd be the man"

​this is me trying Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Verse 2]
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey

[Chorus]
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying


[Post-Chorus]
At least I'm trying

[Bridge]
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town

[Chorus]
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
(And maybe I don't quite know what to say)
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying

[Outro]
At least I'm trying"

My tears ricochet Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
'Til my dying day

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

[Verse 2]
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet


[Bridge]
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you (When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night (You hear my stolen lullabies)

[Chorus]
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet"

Our Thong (Live From Sohoe) Lyrics
[Intro]
One, two

[Verse 1]
I was ridin' yo dick with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He’s got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my ass
I looked around, turn the VCR down
He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say ""Nothing, I was just thinkin' how we don’t have a thong""
And hey says

[Chorus]
Our thong is the smack of my ass
Sneakin' out late, cumming on your window
When we're on the phone, and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late, and your mama don’t know
Our song the the way you cum
The first date, ""Man, I didn't fuck her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""hump me""
Asking God if he could change thongs again

[Verse 2]
I was walkin' up the front porch steps after еverything that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And fuckеd, and thrown away
Got to the hallway, we’ll on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn’t notice all the dildos
And the note that said


[Chorus]
Our thong is the smack of my ass
Sneakin' out late, cumming on your window
When we’re on the phone, and you fuck real slow
'Cause it’s late, and your mama don’t know
Our song the the way you cum
The first date, ""Man, I didn't fuck her, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""hump me""
Asking God if he could change thongs again

[Post-Chorus]
La-da-da-da

[Bridge]
I've watched every porn, fucked to the VCR
Waited for something to come along
That was as wet as our thong

[Chorus]
'Cause our thong is the smack of my ass
Sneakin' out late, cumming on his window
When we’re on the phone, and he fucks real slow
'Cause it’s late, and his mama don’t know
Our song the the way he cums
The first date, ""Man, I didn't fuck him, and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""hump me""
Askin' God if he could change the thongs again, change the thongs again
(Come on now baby, put it in deeper)


[Outro]
I was ridin' you dick, with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a penis, and an old dildo
And I changed our thong
Thank you so much!"

Should’ve Said No (Rhapsody Exclusive) Lyrics
[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me

[Verse 1]
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that you'd take it all back
Given one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me


[Verse 2]
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?

[Pre-Chorus]
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes

[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Oh, oh

[Bridge]
I can't resist
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no
No, no, no, no, no


[Chorus]
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me (Get back to me)
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me"

22 Lyrics
[Verse 1]
It feels like a perfect night
To dress up like hipsters
And make fun of our exes
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It feels like a perfect night
For breakfast at midnight
To fall in love with strangers
Uh-uh, uh-uh

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused, and lonely at the same time
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the deadlines
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will bе alright if
We just keep dancing like we'rе
Twenty-two, twenty-two


[Verse 2]
It seems like one of those nights
This place is too crowded
Too many cool kids
Uh-uh, uh-uh
It seems like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
And end up dreamin'
Instead of sleeping

[Pre-Chorus]
Yeah, we're happy, free, confused, and lonely in the best way
It's miserable and magical, oh, yeah
Tonight's the night when we forget about the heartbreaks
It's time, oh-oh

[Chorus]
(Hey!) I don't know about you
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if (Alright)
We just keep dancing like we're
Twenty-two (Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh), twenty-two (I don't know about you)
Twenty-two, twenty-two (Ooh)


[Bridge]
It feels like one of those nights
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights
We won't be sleepin'
It feels like one of those nights
You look like bad news
I gotta have you
I gotta have you (You)
Woah, ooh, yeah, yeah

[Chorus]
(Hey!) I don't know about you (I don't know about you)
But I'm feeling twenty-two
Everything will be alright if (Ooh)
You keep me next to you
You don't know about me (You don't know about me)
But I'll bet you want to
Everything will be alright if
We just keep dancing like we're (Dancing like we're twenty-two)
Twenty-two (Woah-oh), twenty-two (Dancing like)
Twenty-two (Yeah, yeah), twenty-two (Yeah, yeah, yeah)

[Outro]
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
We ditch the whole scene
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
We won't be sleeping
It feels like one of those nights (Twenty-two)
You look like bad news

You Belong With Me Lyrics
[Verse 1]
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

[Pre-Chorus]
'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm thе one who understands you
Been herе all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Verse 2]
Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?


[Pre-Chorus]
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's cheer captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

[Chorus]
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

[Bridge]
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me

[Chorus]
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


[Outro]
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"

Wildest Dreams Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
Wildest dreams, ah, ha

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But it's gettin' good now

He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

peace (Radio Edit) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly, this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace

[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

[Verse 2]
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk- with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
Is it enough?
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me


[Chorus]
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?"

Shake It Off Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I stay out too late
Got nothin' in my brain
That's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm
I go on too many dates (Haha)
But I can't make them stay
At least, that's what people say, mm-mm
That's what people say, mm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop movin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', ""It's gonna be alright""

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off


[Verse 2]
I never miss a beat
I'm lightnin' on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mm-mm
That's what they don't see, mm-mm
I'm dancin' on my own (Dancin' on my own)
I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mm-mm
That's what they don't know, mm-mm

[Pre-Chorus]
But I keep cruisin'
Can't stop, won't stop groovin'
It's like I got this music in my mind
Sayin', ""It's gonna be alright""

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off


[Post-Chorus]
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey
Just think, while you've been gettin' down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been gettin' down
To this sick beat

[Bridge]
My ex-man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, ""Oh my God,"" but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (Haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (Ha)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (Mmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (They fake and fake and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (I, I)


[Post-Chorus]
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off (Yeah), I shake it off
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (You got to)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"

I Knew You Were Trouble Lyrics
Once upon a time, a few mistakes ago
I was in your sights, you got me alone
You found me, you found me, you found me, e-e-e-e
I guess you didn′t care and I guess I liked that
And when I fell hard, you took a step back
Without me, without me, without me, e-e-e-e

And he's long gone when he′s next to me
And I realize the blame is on me

'Cause I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
′Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I′d never been
Now I'm lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

No apologies, he′ll never see you cry
Pretends he doesn't know that he′s the reason why
You're drowning, you′re drowning, you're drowning, i-i-i-ing
Now I heard you moved on from whispers on the street
A new notch in your belt is all I'll ever be
And now I see, now I see, now I see, e-e-e-e


He was long gone when he met me
And I realize the joke is on me, hey!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I′d never been
′Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been
Now I′m lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble

And the saddest fear
Comes creeping in
That you never loved me
Or her, or anyone, or anything
Yeah!

I knew you were trouble when you walked in
So shame on me now
Flew me to places I'd never been (never been)
′Til you put me down, oh
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
(Knew it right there) so shame on me now (knew it right there)
Flew me to places I'd never been (ooh!)
Now I′m lying on the cold hard ground
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble
Oh, oh, trouble, trouble, trouble


I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble
I knew you were trouble when you walked in
Trouble, trouble, trouble"

You Are In Love (Karaoke Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love

[Verse 2]
You kiss on sidewalks, you fight and you talk
One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says
And you knew what it was, he is in love

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love

[Bridge]
And so it goes
You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round
And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown
And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life


[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love (Ah)
You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you (Ah)
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you (Ah)
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)
You are in love, true love
You are in love"

Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve (Cover) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?

[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, all I used to do was pray
Would've, could've, should've
If you'd never looked my way

[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd lеft me wondering

[Verse 2]
If you nevеr touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us


[Pre-Chorus]
Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith
Would've, could've, should've
If I'd only played it safe

[Chorus]
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering

[Bridge]
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time


[Verse 3]
If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my childhood, it was mine first

[Chorus]
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
At nineteen
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering

[Outro]
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
Oh, God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time"

New Romantics (Karaoke Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We're so young
We play dumb
We cry tears
Honey, life is just a classroom
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah

[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics

[Verse 2]
We're all here
We hang back
It's poker
I'm about to play my Ace
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah


[Chorus]
'Cause, baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics, come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem, we sing it proudly
We are too busy dancin' to get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics

'Cause, baby, I could build a castle

Blank Space Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
""Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So hey, let's be friends
I'm dyin' to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Verse 2]
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessin' like
""Oh my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, hmm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name


[Bridge]
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain

Wildest Dreams Lyrics
[Verse 1]
He said, ""Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds""
I thought, ""Heaven can't help me now""
Nothing lasts forever
But this is gonna take me down

[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, oh
Wildest dreams, ah, oh

[Verse 2]
I said, ""No one has to know what we do""
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
Nothin' lasts forever
But this is gettin' good now


[Pre-Chorus]
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is

[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, oh
Wildest dreams, ah, oh

[Bridge]
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I'll bet these memories
Follow you around ('Round)
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin' it down (Down)
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow you around


[Chorus]
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your (Just pretend, just pretend)
Wildest dreams, ah, oh
In your wildest dreams, ah, oh
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, oh
In your wildest dreams, ah, oh"

But Daddy I Love Him Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I forget how the West was won, I forget if this was ever fun
I just learned these people only raise you to cage you
Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best, clutching their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you 'cause they hate you

[Pre-Chorus]
Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it
They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted

[Chorus]
Now I'm running with my dress unbuttoned
Screaming, ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm telling him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Verse 2]
Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid
Tendrils tucked into a woven braid
Growing up precocious sometimes means not growing up at all
He was chaos, he was revelry; bedroom eyes like a remedy
Soon enough, the elders had convened down at the city hall


[Pre-Chorus]
""Stay away from her""
The saboteurs
Protested too much
Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love

[Chorus]
And I'm running with my dress unbuttoned
Screaming, ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm telling him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitching and moaning
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing

[Bridge]
God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me
And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice


[Verse 3]
There's a lot of people in town that I bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down, went to my parents, and they came around
All the wine moms are still holding out, but fuck 'em, it's over

[Chorus]
Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and
Even my daddy just loves him
I'm his lady
And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want

[Post-Chorus]
I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice

[Outro]
Screaming, ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not
But you should see your faces
But, oh my God, you should see your faces
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
(He was chaos, he was revelry)"

The Black Dog Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I am someone who, until recent events
You shared your secrets with
And your location, you forgot to turn it off
And so I watch as you walk
Into some bar called The Black Dog
And pierce new holes in my heart
You forgot to turn it off
And it hits me

[Chorus]
I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in The Black Dog
When someone plays ""The Starting Line""
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the magic fabric of our dreaming
Old habits die screaming

[Verse 2]
I move through the world with the heartbroken
My longings stay unspoken
And I may never open up the way I did for you
And all of those best laid plans
You said I needed a brave man
Then proceeded to play him
Until I believed it too
And it kills me


[Chorus]
I just don't understand
How you don't miss me in the shower
And remember how my rain-soaked body
Was shakin', do you hate me?
Was it hazing? For a cruel fraternity
I pledged, and I still mean it
Old habits die screaming

[Bridge]
Six weeks of breathin' clean air
I still miss the smoke
Were you makin' fun of me
With some esoteric joke?
Now I wanna sell my house
And set fire to all my clothes
And hire a priest to come and exorcise my demons
Even if I die screaming
And I hope you hear it

[Chorus]
And I hope it's shitty in The Black Dog
When someone plays ""The Starting Line""
And you jump up, but she's too young to know this song
That was intertwined in the tragic fabric of our dreaming
'Cause tail between your legs, you're leavin'


[Outro]
I still can't believe it
'Cause old habits die screaming"

I Know Places (Karaoke Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
—line, sight
By, sign, sign

[Pre-Chorus]
They got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes

[Chorus]
Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places

[Verse 2]
Lights flash and we'll run for the fences
Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time, time

[Pre-Chorus]
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my lovе
They are the huntеrs, we are the foxes

[Chorus]
Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found
And they'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places


[Bridge]
Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it

[Chorus]
Baby
They'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places

[Post-Chorus]
I, I know places
Hide, I know places

Willow Lyrics
[Verse 1: Lacey Johnson]
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine

[Chorus: Lacey Johnson]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

[Verse 2: Lacey Johnson]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was onе prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus: Lacey Johnson]
The morе that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


[Bridge: Lacey Johnson]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend

[Verse 2: Lacey Johnson]
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win

[Chorus: Lacey Johnson]
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man


[Outro]
Hey, that's my man
That's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
That's my man
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man"

Lover Lyrics
[Verse 1]
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover

[Verse 2]
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make thе call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I'vе loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my lover


[Bridge]
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover

[Chorus]
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home (Forever and ever)
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover"

You’re Losing Me X Cornelia Street Lyrics
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger
Than the drinks in the bar
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street,""
I say casually in the car


Remember lookin' at this room?
We loved 'cause of the light
Now I just sit in the dark and
Wonder if it's time

Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always rinsing from the ashes
Mending all her gashes...

You might just have dealt the final blow


And I hope I never losе you
Hope it never еnds
(You're Losing Me)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
(You're Losing Me)


That's the kind of heartbreak time could never mend
(You're Losing Me)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how
This city screams your name
('Cause you're losing me)

And baby, I'm so terrified of
If you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again


Every morning I'd glare at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone
You can't tell is dying?


Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone


And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now you're running down the hallway
You know what they all say
You don't know what you've got, until it's gone



And I hope I never lose you
Hope it never ends
(You're Losing Me)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
(You're Losing Me)


That's the kind of heartbreak time could never mend
(You're Losing Me)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how
This city screams your name
('Cause you're losing me)

And baby, I'm so terrified of
('Cause you're losing me.)
If you ever walk away
(Stop, stop, stop.)
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
('Cause you're losing me.)


(My heart won't start anymore
(I'd never walk Cornelia Street again.)
My heart won't start anymore
('Cause you're losing me.)


You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion
Listen...


Fighting in only your army
Frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party
You're losing me...

And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people-pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her


And baby, I get mystified by how
This city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of
If you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
(You're losing me)

(Stop, stop, stop. You're losing me)
(I don't wanna lose you, stop.)
(Hope it never ends.)
(I'd never walk Cornelia Street again.)
(You're Losing Me)
(I don't wanna lose you.)

I can't find a pulse, my heart won't start anymore
""I rent a place on Cornelia Street,""
I say casually in the car"

You Belong With Me Lyrics
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do

But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the onе who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You bеlong with me, you belong with me

Walk in the streets with you in your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
""Hey, isn't this easy?""

And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, what you doing with a girl like that?


She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain, and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming about the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time

If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me

Oh, I remember you driving to my house in the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh when you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs and you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong, think I know it's with me

Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you?
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me

Standing by and waiting at your backdoor
All this time how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


You belong with me
Have you ever thought, just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"

Anti-Hero (Candle Light MIx) Lyrics
I have this thing where I get older but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
All of the people I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis (tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

Sometimes I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman? (Tale as old as time)
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)


It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero

I have this dream my daughter in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from hell""

It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi, everybody agrees, everybody agrees

It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea (tea) time (time), everybody agrees (everybody agrees)
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
It's me, hi (hi), I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)
At tea time, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"

Love Story Lyrics
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standin' there
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know

That you were Romeo, you were throwin' pebbles
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was cryin' on the staircase
Beggin' you, ""Please don't go, "" and I said

Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""

So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet, 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh oh

'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was beggin' you, ""Please don't go, "" and I said


Romeo, save me, they're tryna tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh

I got tired of waiting
Wonderin' if you were ever comin' around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town, and I said

Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring
And said, ""Marry me, Juliet
You'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

I shake it off, I shake it off

[Verse 2]
I never miss a beat, I'm lightning on my feet
And that's what they don't see, mm-mm, that's what they don't see, mm-mm
I'm dancing on my own (Dancing on my own), I make the moves up as I go (Moves up as I go)
And that's what they don't know, mm-mm, that's what they don't know, mm-mm

Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off

[Post-Chorus]
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off

[Interlude]
Hey, hey, hey
Just think, while you've been getting down and out about the liars
And the dirty, dirty cheats of the world
You could've been getting down
To this sick beat


[Bridge]
My ex man brought his new girlfriend
She's like, ""Oh my God,"" but I'm just gonna shake
And to the fella over there with the hella good hair
Won't you come on over, baby?
We can shake, shake, shake
Yeah, oh-oh, oh

[Chorus]
'Cause the players gonna play, play, play, play, play
And the haters gonna hate, hate, hate, hate, hate (Haters gonna hate)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (Ha)
Heartbreakers gonna break, break, break, break, break (Mmm)
And the fakers gonna fake, fake, fake, fake, fake (They fake and fake and fake)
Baby, I'm just gonna shake, shake, shake, shake, shake
I shake it off, I shake it off (I, I)

[Post-Chorus]
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off (Yeah), I shake it off
I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off (You got to)
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off
I, I, I shake it off, I shake it off"

Golden Cage Lyrics
[Taylor Swift - Intro & Verse 1]
(A bright, clean acoustic guitar and light synth lead the track)
I remember the skyline from the window of a Greyhound bus
It looked like a promise back then, shining just for us
We were sixteen, maybe seventeen, sketching names on a dirty glass pane
Wishing on a star that knew nothing about the pouring rain
Now the view is different, they built the walls so high
And the spotlight’s a perfect circle that follows you into the sky
I got the key to the city, but the locks are all on the inside. (Oh, isn't that nice?)
This velvet life, this gilded truth... where exactly can I hide?

[Taylor Swift - Chorus]
Welcome to the top floor, where the silence is so loud
You can wave to the people but you can’t escape the crowd
They polished the bars until they shimmered like gold leaf
Gave me everything I wanted, gave me endless grief
It’s a Golden Cage, honey, perfectly constructed
The most beautiful prison—totally unobstructed
I’m singing through the wire mesh, hoping someone hears the plea
I thought I flew away, but the cage just followed me. (It followed me)

[K-Cipher - Verse 2]
(Beat drops harder, synth bassline takes over. K-Cipher enters with a sharp, narrative flow)
Yo, I’m standing on the pavement, looking up at the penthouse suite. (Uh-huh)
They call my block a dungeon, but at least the bars are concrete
You talk about a cage that’s shining; mine was stained with rust
Fighting just to breathe the air, tryna turn the dirt to trust
My perspective is parallel, we’re both trapped in the optics
You’re boxed in by the velvet rope, I’m caged by the toxic
Cycle of the poverty that keeps the dreams on ice
The price of admission is your identity—you pay it twice
They cheer for the teen rapper, the story of the escape artist
But they don’t see the blueprint, the hunger that’s the sharpest
Taylor, your walls are crystal, mine were cinder block and grime
But the common denominator? We’re both running out of time. (Running out)


[Taylor Swift - Chorus]
Welcome to the top floor, where the silence is so loud
You can wave to the people but you can’t escape the crowd. (No, you can't)
They polished the bars until they shimmered like gold leaf
Gave me everything I wanted, gave me endless grief
It’s a Golden Cage, honey, perfectly constructed
The most beautiful prison—totally unobstructed
I’m singing through the wire mesh, hoping someone hears the plea
I thought I flew away, but the cage just followed me

[Bridge - Duet: K-Cipher & Taylor Swift]
K-Cipher: The freedom’s a mirage, the success is just a disguise. (It’s a lie)
Taylor Swift: We bought the fairytale, now we're paying for the surprise. (Ooh, that hurt)
K-Cipher: They want the show, they want the flaw, the drama and the hype
Taylor Swift: But all I want is that simple bench under the street light
Both: We trade one cage for another, trading grit for the gleam
We’re living the high-res version of a broken, beautiful dream

[K-Cipher - Outro]
Yeah... The price of the ticket, man
The Chronicles of the Caged Bird... Chapter Six
Doesn't matter if the bars are gold or iron, a lock is still a lock. (Checkmate)
We just learned how to rap from the inside out
(It's true.)"

Blonde (unreleased Lyrics
[Intro]
This song is starring Taylor
The ionic blonde
Ok?
The one and only

[Verse 1]
You know we are lucky to have you, queen
But we are even more luck is that I
I shone the spotlight on those artificial curls
You're so into drama
Your album cover hits that sweet spot (ah)
God, this generation

[Pre-Chorus]
I let you bloom
Now you're so all high and mighty
Went on my tour once
Now you run pop culture

{Chorus]
Yeah, we are both blonde and unique
But remember my curls are natural
You use a wig
You'll fade out soon
I know I stick
Don't forget it


[Verse 2]
You know you'll never find another like me
You're just copy and pastе plus freaky
I, I shone the spotlight on that fakе laugh
You're so into diss tracks
Guess you're never wrong (ah)

[Pre-Chorus]
I let you bloom
Now you're so all high and mighty
Went on my tour once
Now you run pop culture

{Chorus]
Yeah, we are both blonde and unique
But remember my curls are natural
You use a wig
You'll fade out soon
I know I stick
Don't forget it

[Bridge]
Now people will hate like they always do
It's the life of a showgirl, ayyy
But tell me
Which is more sophisticated
A French blonde cocktail or some espresso
I don't even know what kind


{Chorus]
Yeah, we are both blonde and unique
But remember my curls are natural
You use a wig
You'll fade out soon
I know I stick
Don't forget it

[Outro]
Blondie
Don't forget it
I'm such a cool barbie
Love you though, queen"

So High School Lyrics
[Verse 1]
I feel so high school every time I look at you
I wanna find you in a crowd just to hide from you

[Pre-Chorus]
And in the blink of a crinkling eye
I'm sinking, our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think, and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly

[Chorus]
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school every time I look at you
But look at you

[Post-Chorus]
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah

[Interlude]
Are you gonna marry, kiss, or kill me? (Kill me)
It's just a game, but really (Really)
I'm bettin' on all three (All three) for us two
Get my car door, isn't that sweet? (That sweet)
Then pull me to the back seat (The back seat)
No one's ever had me (Had me), not like you


[Refrain]
Truth, dare, spin bottles
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, scout's honor
You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle
You already know, babe

[Verse 2]
I feel like laughin' in the middle of practice
Do that impression you did of your dad again
I'm hearing voices like a madman

[Pre-Chorus]
And in the blink of a crinklin' eye
I'm sinkin', our fingers entwined
Cheeks pink in the twinkling lights
Tell me 'bout the first time you saw me
I'll drink what you think, and I'm high
From smokin' your jokes all damn night
The brink of a wrinkle in time
Bittersweet sixteen suddenly

[Chorus]
I'm watchin' American Pie with you on a Saturday night
Your friends are around, so be quiet
I'm tryin' to stifle my sighs
'Cause I feel so high school (I feel so high school) every time I look at you
But look at you


[Refrain]
Truth, dare, spin bottles (Yeah)
You know how to ball, I know Aristotle
Brand new, full throttle (Yeah)
Touch me while your bros play Grand Theft Auto
It's true, swear, scout's honor (Yeah)
You knew what you wanted and, boy, you got her
Brand new, full throttle (Yeah)
You already know, babe
You already know, babe"

(A daydream)
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank spacе, baby
And I'll write your name"

blank space (taylor remix) Lyrics
[Verse]
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?""
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend

[Chorus]
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"

Cruel Summer Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)

[Pre-Chorus]
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more

[Chorus]
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruеl summer with you

[Verse 2]
Hang your head low in the glow of thе vending machine
I'm not dying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying (Oh yeah, you're right, I want it)


[Pre-Chorus]
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh

[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Bridge]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil


[Chorus]
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, whoa-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
But ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer with you

[Outro]
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar (Oh)
Said, ""I'm fine,"" but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate (Oh)
And I scream, ""For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?""
(Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)"

Eldest Daughter x loml Lyrics
(Verse 1)
Everybody's so punk on the internet
Everyone's unbothered 'til they're not
Every joke's just trolling and memes
Sad as it seems, apathy is hot
Everybody's cutthroat in the comments
Every single hot take is cold as ice
When you found me I said I was busy
That was a lie

(Pre-Chorus)
I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness
I've been dying just from trying to seem cool

(Chorus 1)
But I'm not the baddest
And this isn't savage
But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now

(Verse 2)
Who's gonna tell me the truth
When you blew in with the winds of fate
And told me I reformed you
When your impressionist paintings of Heaven
Turned out to be fakes
Well, you took me to hell, too
And all at once, the ink bleeds
A con man sells a fool a get-love-quick scheme
But I felt a hole like this
Never before, and ever since


(Chorus 2)
If you know it in one glimpse
It's legendary
What we thought was for all time
Was momentary
Still alive, killing time at the cemetery
Never quite buried
You cinephile in black and white
All those plot twists and dynamite
Mr. Steal Your Girl, then make her cry
You said I'm the love of your life

(Bridge)
You shit-talked me under the table
Talking rings and talking cradles
I wish I could un-recall
How we almost had it all
Dancing phantoms on the terrace
Are they second-hand embarrassed
That I can't get out of bed?
Cause something counterfeit's dead

(Chorus)
'Cause I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage
And I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors
Smooth operators
But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now


(Post-Chorus)
Never gonna break that vow
Never gonna leave you now, now
I'm never gonna leave you now"

deja vu (Clean Version) Lyrics
[Verse 1]
Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
And tradin' jackets
Laughin' 'bout how small it looks on you
(Ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, ha-ha-ha-ha)
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin' in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm

[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Ah) Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?

[Verse 2]
Do you call her, almost say my name?
'Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
Another actress
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
'Cause you played her ""Uptown Girl""
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse (Ooh; I love you)


[Chorus]
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? (Oh-oh)
Do you get déjà vu?

[Bridge]
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do all that, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
(Yeah, everything is all reused)
Play her piano, but she doesn't know (Oh, oh)
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel (Oh)
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

[Outro]
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu
I know you get déjà vu"

Long Live the Queen Lyrics
[Verse 1: Nómada]
Vejo-te entrando no Palacio da capital
Isaura sempre linda
Como sempre fenomenal
Tiara na cabeca
No pescoco o teu colar
Que eu tinha te oferecido
Antes de nos namorar
E como rei Isaura
Eu so tenho a agradecer
De ter uma rainha como tu
Ser minha mulher
Es tipo uma medusa
Todo mundo olha e para
So vou pedir um favor
Antes que um gajo para

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Nómada] x2
Peço que lembres de mim
Da nossa vivencia
Da tua alegria com o rei
Mesmo que sеja o fim
Nao importa onde esteja
Tе darei pra sempre o meu amor
Isaura Queen
Isauuu-ra
Isaura Queen
Isauuu-ra


[Verse 2: Nómada]
So nos soubemos
Sobre o que nos passamos
Para poder reinar
E tu rainha sempre ao lado pra me aconselhar
Quando tu andas
E te abanas
E sentimental
Tanta nobreza
Que demonstras
Familia real
Quando eu me ausento
O meu trono sempre sera teu
Como nao seria
Depois do principe
Que voce me deu
Ja nao es princesa
Agora es anfitria
Acima de ti
Minha virgen-lhe
Ta somente
A Minha mama {Rute}

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Nómada] x2
Peço que lembres de mim
Da nossa vivencia
Da tua alegria com o rei
Mesmo que seja o fim
Nao importa onde esteja
Te darei pra sempre o meu amor
Isaura Queen
Isauuu-ra
Isaura Queen
Isauuu-ra


[Bridge: Taylor Swift & Nómada] x2
Mesmo que eu nao esteja mais
Mesmo ca tendo guerra ou paz
Vamos ficar
Mesmo que eu ja nao esteja aqui
Ou talvez outra conheci
Vamos ficar

[Chorus: Taylor Swift & Nómada] x2
Peço que lembres de mim
Da nossa vivencia
Da tua alegria com o rei
Mesmo que seja o fim
Nao importa onde esteja
Te darei pra sempre o meu amor

Isaura Queen

My Tears Ricochet - Jabran Khan Remix Lyrics
We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes too (you'll be made of ashes too)

Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?

'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
Till my dying day

Ricochet

I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?

Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

My tears ricochet

We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you

But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me


I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave

And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want

Just no home

And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you
(When I'm screaming at the sky)
And when you can't sleep at night
(You hear my stolen lullabies)"
