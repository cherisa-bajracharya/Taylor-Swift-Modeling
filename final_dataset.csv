1989,1,Welcome To New York,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-welcome-to-new-york-taylors-version-lyrics,"Walkin' through a crowd, the village is aglow

Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats

Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before

And it said


""Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you""
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermorе

The lights are so bright, but they nеver blind me, me

Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York



When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors

Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer

Everybody here was someone else before

And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls



Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore

The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York




Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything


Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat

The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, new soundtrack
It's been waitin' for you, welcome to New York
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, so bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York"
1989,2,Blank Space,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-blank-space-lyrics,"Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things

Magic, madness, heaven, sin

Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face

You look like my next mistake

Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine

Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends

Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend



So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

'Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name




Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month

Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns

Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream



So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Oh)
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless (Oh-oh), mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name




Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya



So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane (I'm insane)

'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game (And you love the game)
'Cause we're young and we're reckless (Yeah)
We'll take this way too far (Ooh)
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar (With a nasty scar)
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name"
1989,3,Style,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-style-lyrics,"Midnight
You come and pick me up, no headlights
Long drive
Could end in burning flames or paradise

Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
(Heard from you)



And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time



You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt

And I got that good-girl faith and a tight little skirt

And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style



So it goes
He can't keep his wild eyes on the road, mm

Takes me home
The lights are off, he's taking off his coat, mm, yeah

I say, ""I heard, oh
That you've been out and about with some other girl""
Some other girl




He says, ""What you heard is true, but I

Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I""

I said, ""I've been there too, a few times""



You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt

And I got that good-girl faith and a tight little skirt (A tight little skirt)

And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

'Cause we never go out of style (We never go, we never go), we never go out of style



Take me home (Ah)
Just take me home (Ah)
Yeah, just take me home (Ah)
Oh-oh, woah-oh, oh (Out of style)



Oh, you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

And when we go crashing down (And when we go), we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style"
1989,4,Out Of The Woods,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-out-of-the-woods-lyrics,"Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch

I remember

You took a Polaroid of us

Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinking


Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

(Are we out of the woods?)




Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck

The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance

Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

And I remember thinking



Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

(Are we out of the woods?)



Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you

Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, ""I'm setting you free""

But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?)
(Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?)
I remember
(Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?)
(Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good)
Oh, I remember




Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? (Yeah)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? (Say, are we?)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah) Are we in the clear yet? (Yeah)
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Clear yet? Good)

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good (Do you remember?)
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good"

People like you always want back
The love they gave away
And people like me wanna believe you
When you say you've changed

The more I think about it now
The less I know

All I know is that you drove us
Off the road



(Stay) Hey, all you had to do was stay

Had me in the palm of your hand, then

Why'd you have to go and lock me out when I let you in?

Had me in the palm of your hand, then

Makes you want to run and hide
But it makes you turn right back around

Wish you knew that
I'd never forget you as long as I live and I

1989,11,This Love,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-this-love-lyrics,"Clear blue water
High tide came and brought you in
And I could go on and on, on and on and I will
Skies grew darker
Currents swept you out again
And you were just gone and gone, gone and gone



In silent screams and wildest dreams
I never dreamed of this



This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh



Tossing, turning
Struggled through the night with someone new
Baby, I could go on and on, on and on

Lantern, burning
Flickered in my mind, only you
But you were still gone, gone, gone




Been losing grip on sinking ships
You showed up just in time



This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

This love left a permanent mark

This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh

These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh


(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love, oh-oh, oh)
(This love, this love, this love, this love)


Your kiss, my cheek, I watched you leave
Your smile, my ghost, I fell to my knees

When you're young, you just run
But you come back to what you need




This love is good, this love is bad
This love is alive back from the dead, oh-oh, oh
These hands had to let it go free, and
This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

(This love) This love left a permanent mark

(This love) This love is glowing in the dark, oh-oh, oh

(This love) These hands had to let it go free, and
(This love) This love came back to me, oh-oh, oh

I-I-I-I, I-I-I-I, I-I (I, I)


You stand with your hand on my waistline
It's a scene and we're out here in plain sight
I can hear them whisper as we pass by
It's a bad sign, bad sign

Somethin' happens when everybody finds out

See the vultures circling, dark clouds

Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out



'Cause they got the cages, they got the boxes and guns
They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run



Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places


Lights flash and we'll run for the fences

Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time




Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run



Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found
And they'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places


They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run

Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love



Baby (Baby), I know places we won't be found
And they'll (They'll) be (Be) chasing their tails tryin' to track us down
'Cause I, I know places we can hide

When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst

It was months and months of back and forth, ah-ah, ah-ah
You're still all over me like a wine-stained dress I can't wear anymore



Hung my head as I lost the war

And the sky turned black like a perfect storm



The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe

And by mornin'
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean



There was nothin' left to do, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the butterflies turned to dust that covered my whole room

So I punched a hole in the roof, ah-ah, ah-ah
Let the flood carry away all my pictures of you



The water filled my lungs, I screamed so loud
But no one heard a thing




The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe

And by mornin'
Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean


I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Said, I think I am finally clean
Ah-ah-ah-ah


Ten months sober, I must admit
Just because you're clean, don't mean you don't miss it
Ten months older, I won't give in
Now that I'm clean, I'm never gonna risk it

The drought was the very worst, ah-ah, ah-ah
When the flowers that we'd grown together died of thirst (Oh)




The rain came pouring down
When I was drownin', that's when I could finally breathe

Gone was any trace of you, I think I am finally clean

Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats

Everybody here wanted somethin' more
Searchin' for a sound we hadn't heard before

And it said


""Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you""
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermorе

The lights are so bright, but they nеver blind me, me

Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York



When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors

Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer

Everybody here was someone else before

And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls



Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat forevermore

The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me

Welcome to New York (New York), it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York




Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything


Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waitin' for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York

It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat

The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, new soundtrack
It's been waitin' for you, welcome to New York
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York, so bright, they never blind me

I could show you incredible things

Magic, madness, heaven, sin

Saw you there and I thought
""Oh, my God, look at that face

You look like my next mistake

Love's a game, wanna play?"" Ayy

New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine

Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me

So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends

Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend



So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

'Cause you know I love the players

And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name




Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen

Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month

Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no

Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns

Keep you second guessing, like
""Oh, my God, who is she?""
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream



So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain

Got a long list of ex-lovers

And you love the game

They'll tell you I'm insane (Insane)

But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name




Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya



So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?

You can tell me when it's over (Over), mm

And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time

And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

You got that long hair, slicked back, white T-shirt

And I got that good-girl faith and a tight little skirt

It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch

I remember

You took a Polaroid of us

Then discovered (Then discovered)
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color

And I remember thinking


Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Looking at it now
Last December (Last December)
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together (Back together)

Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck

The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance

Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying

And I remember thinking



Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

Are we out of the woods yet? (Oh) Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good

(Are we out of the woods?)



Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you

Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, ""I'm setting you free""

But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me

Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?

Still got scars on my back from your knife

Somethin' happens when everybody finds out

See the vultures circling, dark clouds

Love's a fragile little flame, it could burn out
It could burn out

They are the hunters, we are the foxes and we run



Baby, I know places we won't be found
And they'll be chasing their tails tryin' to track us down

'Cause I, I know places we can hide
I know places, I know places


Lights flash and we'll run for the fences

Let them say what they want, we won't hear it
Loose lips sink ships all the damn time
Not this time




Just grab my hand and don't ever drop it, my love

And whispers turned to talkin'
And talking turned to screams, oh

Didn't you flash your green eyes at me?
Didn't you calm my fears with a Cheshire cat smile?

Ooh, didn't it all seem new and exciting?

I reached for you, but you were gone
I knew I had to go back home
You searched the world for somethin' else
To make you feel like what we had

And in the end, in Wonderland, we both went mad

Oh

Small talk, he drives, coffee at midnight
The light reflects the chain on your neck

He says, ""Look up"" and your shoulders brush
No proof, one touch, but you felt enough

You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)

You are in love



Morning, his place, burnt toast, Sunday

You keep his shirt, he keeps his word

And for once, you let go of your fears and your ghosts

One step, not much, but it said enough

You kiss on sidewalks, you fight and you talk

One night, he wakes, strange look on his face
Pauses, then says ""You're my best friend""
And you knew what it was, he is in love




You can hear it in the silence (Silence), silence (Silence), you
You can feel it on the way home (Way home), way home (Way home), you
You can see it with the lights out (Lights out), lights out (Lights out)

You two are dancing in a snow globe, 'round and 'round

And he keeps a picture of you in his office downtown

And you understand now
Why they lost their minds and fought the wars
And why I've spent my whole life trying to put it into words

Would surprise the whole school
When I ended up back at our class reunion

Walkin' in with you
You'd be more than a chapter in my old diaries

With the pages ripped out
I am standin' in a 1950s gymnasium

And I can still see you now



I didn't come here to make friends
We were born to be suburban legends
When you hold me, it holds me together
And you kiss me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever

I know that you still remember

We were born to be national treasures
When you told me we'd get back together

And you kissed me in a way that's gonna screw me up forever



Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block

I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it

Waves crash on the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore and my whole life's ruined

Tick-tock on the clock, I pace down your block
I broke my own heart 'cause you were too polite to do it

Waves crash to the shore, I dash to the door
You don't knock anymore and I always knew it
That my life would be ruined"

Once the flight had flown (Uh-huh)

With the wilt of the rose (Uh-huh)

I slept all alone (Uh-huh)
You still wouldn't go



Let's fast forward to three hundred takeout coffees later
I see your profile and your smile on unsuspecting waiters

You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor

You search in every maiden's bed for somethin' greater, baby



Was it over when she laid down on your couch?

Was it over when he unbuttoned my blouse?

""Come here,"" I whispered in your ear
In your dream as you passеd out, baby
Was it over then? And is it over now?

Whеn you lost control (Uh-huh)
Red blood, white snow (Uh-huh)

Blue dress on a boat (Uh-huh)

Your new girl is my clone




And did you think I didn't see you?
There were flashin' lights

At least I had the decency
To keep my nights out of sight

Only rumors 'bout my hips and thighs
And my whispered sighs

Oh, Lord, I think about jumpin'
Off of very tall somethings

Just to see you come runnin'

And say the one thing I've been wanting, but no



Let's fast forward to three hundred awkward blind dates later
 (Oh)
If she's got blue eyes, I will surmise that you'll probably date her (Oh, no)

You dream of my mouth before it called you a lying traitor (Oh)

You search in every model's bed for somethin' greater, baby

You walk me to the car

And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parkin' lot, yeah
Oh, yeah



We're driving down the road
I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool
Run your hands through your hair
Absent-mindedly makin' me want you



And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless



So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one-horse town,
 I wanna stay right here

Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
It's fearless

Oh, yeah

Fearless,2,Fifteen,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-fifteen-lyrics,"In “Fifteen,” Taylor looks back at her freshman year at Hendersonville High. Taylor wrote the song about her best friend, Abigail Anderson, who she met during ninth grade and is still best friends with.

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say ""hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town

Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""



'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them

And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be

Fifteen


You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends

Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool

We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'

And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends




'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen



When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried



'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall

I've found time can heal most anything

And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen



La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la


Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"
Fearless,3,Love Story,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-love-story-lyrics,"We were both young when I first saw you

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know



That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said



Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew

So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh




'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said



Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


Oh, oh


But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said


""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""



Oh, oh, oh

Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you

And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window

I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold

Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone



'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel

Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same




'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel

Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out

And pull me near and shine, shine, shine


Hey, Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha)



I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else

Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else

Comes out just when you need it to

As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known



That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale

I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around



Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know



That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around




And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry


'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale

I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now

And it's too late for you and your white horse

I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like

And she'll never know your story like I do


'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town

I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?



She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Standing by and waiting at your back door

All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams

Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me


Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door

Talks business with my father

I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold

I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home



I don't know why all the trees change in the fall

But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today



I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names



I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school

But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today



I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run

And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs

And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world



And now, I know why all the trees change in the fall

I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes

For staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today"

But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through


Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down

This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh



So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair

We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this


'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down

This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh




Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight



It was the night things changed

These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down

And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless



Oh-oh


Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really somethin'
It's fearless

Oh, yeah


'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless

'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why, but with you, I'd dance
In a storm, in my best dress, fearless




Oh-oh
Oh-oh, yeah"
Fearless (Taylor's Version),2,Fifteen (Taylor’s Version),https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-fifteen-lyrics,"In “Fifteen,” Taylor looks back at her freshman year at Hendersonville High. Taylor wrote the song about her best friend, Abigail Anderson, who she met during ninth grade and is still best friends with.

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say ""hi"" to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way

It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town

Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
""You know, I haven't seen you around before""



'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them

And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be

Fifteen


You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends

Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool

We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'

And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends




'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen



When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now

Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine

And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried



'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall

I've found time can heal most anything

And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
At fifteen



La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la


Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors"
Fearless (Taylor's Version),3,Love Story (Taylor’s Version),https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-love-story-lyrics,"We were both young when I first saw you

I close my eyes and the flashback starts
I'm standing there
On a balcony in summer air

See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns

See you make your way through the crowd
And say, ""Hello""
Little did I know



That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said



Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run

You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess

It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew

So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh




'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter

And my daddy said, ""Stay away from Juliet""
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, ""Please don't go,"" and I said



Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, ""Yes""


Oh, oh


But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said


""Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think""

He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
""Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress

It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'""



Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you"

Mmm-mm, mm-mm
Mmm-mm, mm-mm, yeah


Hey, Stephen, I know looks can be deceiving
But I know I saw a light in you

And as we walked, we were talking
I didn't say half the things I wanted to
Of all the girls tossing rocks at your window

I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold

Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone



'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel

Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you

Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha
I've seen it all, so I thought
But I never seen nobody shine the way you do

The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same




'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself


They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out

And pull me near and shine, shine, shine


Hey, Stephen, I could give you fifty reasons
Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you? (Ha-ha)



I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else

Mmm, I can't help myself
If you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself

Fearless (Taylor's Version),5,White Horse (Taylor’s Version),https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-white-horse-lyrics,"Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to

As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known



That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale

I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around



Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know



That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell

This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town

I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To come around




And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry


'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale

I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now

And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now


Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now"

She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like

And she'll never know your story like I do


'Cause she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Walk in the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?

And you've got a smile that can light up this whole town

I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?



She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers

Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time


If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door

All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me


Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams

Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me


Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door

All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me



You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me"

And you might think I'm bulletproof, but I'm not
You took a swing, I took it hard
And down here from the ground, I see who you are



I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you love me, then cut me down
And I need you like a heartbeat
But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around

And here's to you and your temper

Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why


You could write a book on how to ruin someone's perfect day

Well, I get so confused and frustrated
Forget what I'm trying to say, oh


I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I got no one to believe in
You tell me that you want me, then push me around

But you know you got a mean streak
That makes me run for cover when you're around

Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why



Why do you have to make me feel small
So you can feel whole inside?
Why do you have to put down my dreams
So you're the only thing on my mind?



I'm sick and tired of your attitude
I'm feeling like I don't know you
You tell me that you want me, then cut me down

I'm sick and tired of your reasons
I've got no one to believe in
You ask me for my love, then you push me around
Here's to you and your temper
Yes, I remember what you said last night
And I know that you see what you're doing to me
Tell me why (Why)
Tell me why (Why)

I told you I'm not bulletproof

I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down

And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around



You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone

And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before

You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no

And all my single friends are jealous
He says everything I need to hear and it's like I couldn't ask for anything better
He opens up my door and I get into his car
And he says, ""You look beautiful tonight""
And I feel perfectly fine



But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you act insane
And that's the way I loved you

Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you


He respects my space
And never makes me wait

And he calls exactly when he says he will
He's close to my mother
Talks business with my father

He's charming and endearing
And I'm comfortable



But I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
And it's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
You're so in love that you acted insane
And that's the way I loved you

Breaking down and coming undone
It's a, a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much
And that's the way I loved you


He can't see the smile I'm faking
And my heart's not breaking
'Cause I'm not feeling anything at all

And you were wild and crazy
Just so frustrating
Intoxicating, complicated

Got away by some mistake and now


I miss screaming and fighting and kissing in the rain
It's 2AM and I'm cursing your name
I'm so in love that I acted insane
And that's the way I loved you

Breaking down and coming undone
It's a roller coaster kind of rush
And I never knew I could feel that much

Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure

Here's to silence that cuts me to the core

Where is this going?

I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold

I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home



I don't know why all the trees change in the fall

But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today



I'm thirteen now
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names



I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school

But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today



I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run

And I had the best days with you


There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs

And Daddy's smart
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world



And now, I know why all the trees change in the fall

I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes

For staying back and watching me shine

And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today"

Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down

This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Oh, oh



So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair

We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared

You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this


'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down

This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah

Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight



It was the night things changed

These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down

Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""



Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing

Here's to silence that cuts me to the core

Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore



And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

And you flashback to when he said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
You didn't mean it, baby, I don't think so


Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?


'Cause it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all

And you flashback to when we said, ""Forever and always""
And it rains in your bedroom
Everything is wrong
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone

'Cause I was there when you said, ""Forever and always""



You didn't mean it, baby
You said, ""Forever and always"", yeah"

Talk to the man with the reasons why

I'll leave my window open
'Cause I'm too tired at night to call your name
Just know, I'm right here hopin'
That you'll come in with the rain



I could stand up and sing you a song
But I don't wanna have to go that far

And I, I've got you down, I know you by heart
And you don't even know where I start


Talk to yourself, talk to the tears
Talk to the man who put you here
And don't wait for the sky to clear



I'll leave my window open

Screamed your name

Help but wish I could see your face

You smile that beautiful smile
And all the girls in the front row
Scream your name



So dim that spotlight, tell me things like
""I can't keep my eyes off of you""

I'm no one special, just another wide-eyed girl

Who's desperately in love with you
Give me a photograph to hang on my wall

Dreamin' about you

Whеn my world wakes up today
You'll be in another town

I'd be counting down the ways to see you

I'm invisible and everyone knows who you are
And you'll never see, you sing me to sleep

But I'm not picking up

I might tell you that it's over
But if you look a little closer



I said, ""Leave,"" but all I really want is you
To stand outside my window throwing pebbles

Screaming, ""I'm in love with you""

Wait there in the pouring rain, coming back for more

And don't you leave, 'cause I know all I need is on
The other side of the door


Me and my stupid pride are sitting here alone

Going through the photographs, staring at the phone
I keep going back over things we both said
And I remember the slamming door

And all the things that I misread



So, babe, if you know everything
Tell me why you couldn't see
When I left, I wanted you to chase after me, yeah

With your face and the beautiful eyes

And the conversation with the little white lies

And the faded picture of a beautiful night
You carried me from your car up the stairs
And I broke down crying, was she worth this mess?

After everything and that little black dress

After everything, I must confess, I need you"

On old county roads
They leave it muddy underneath
Reminds me of you


You find graffiti on the walls
Of old bathroom stalls
You know, you can scratch it off
It's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket
That's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been
Reminds me of me


And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, held on
God knows too long
And wasted time, lost tears
Sworе that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gеts you clean
I've still got you all over me



The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your ""Don't you wish you had me?"" grin
I did, so I smiled
And I melted like a child
Now, every breath of air I breathe
Reminds me of back then


And I lived, and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out, and held on
God knows too long
And wasted my time, lost tears
Swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me




I lived, and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around see
That we were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I tried
And I watched a part of myself die

I've still got you all over me

When the porch lights were shinin' bright
Before I had somewhere to be
Back when we had all night
And we were happy

I do recall a good while back

We snuck into the circus

You threw your arms around my neck
Back when I deserved it
And we were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday

And we were happy


We used to watch the Sun go down
On the boats in the water

That's sorta how I feel right now
And goodbye's so much harder
'Cause we were happy



When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm
We were gonna buy someday
And we were happy


We were happy


Oh, I hate those voices
Tellin' me I'm not in love anymore
But they don't give me choices
And that's what these tears are for


'Cause we were happy
We were happy


When it was good, baby, it was good, baby
We showed 'em all up
No one could touch the way we
Laughed in the dark, talkin' 'bout your daddy's farm

I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing

And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

Bye, bye, baby


The picture frame is empty

On the dresser, vacant just like me
I see your writing on the dash
Then back to your hesitation
I was so sure of everything
Everything I thought we'd always have
Guess I never doubted it
Then the here and the now floods in
Feels like I'm becoming a part of your past




Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing
And all I have is your sympathy
'Cause you took me home but you just couldn't keep me

Bye, bye, baby


And there's so much that I can't touch

You're all I want, but it's not enough this time
And all the pages are just slipping through my hands

And I'm so scared of how this ends



Bye, bye to everything I thought was on my side
Bye, bye, baby
I want you bad, but it's come down to nothing

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
Sequin smile, black lipstick
Sensual politics
When you are young, they assume you know nothing


But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
I knew you
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, thеy assume you know nothing



But I knew you
Playing hide-and-seek and
Giving mе your weekends, I
I knew you
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite


To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'


I knew you
Steppin' on my last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
I knew you
Tried to change the ending
Peter leaving Wendy, I
I knew you
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing



But I knew you'd linger like a stolen kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
I knew I'd wish you would've changed your mind
I knew you'd miss me once the moment died
I knew to love would be to lose my mind
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back


And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
Under someone's bed
You put me on and said I was your favorite"

So peaceful and quiet
I forgot that you existed
It isn't love, it isn't hate, it's just indifference
I forgot that you



Got out some popcorn
As soon as my rep started going down, down, down

Laughed on the school yard
As soon as I tripped up and hit the ground, ground, ground

And I would've stuck around for ya
Would've fought the whole town, so yeah

Taught me some hard lessons

Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends

I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?

Who could stay?
Who could stay?
Who could stay?
You could stay
You could stay

Lover,6,I Think He Knows,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-i-think-he-knows-lyrics,"I think he knows
His footprints on the sidewalk
Lead to where I can't stop
Go there every night

I think he knows
His hands around a cold glass
Make me wanna know that
Body like it's mine



He got that boyish look that I like in a man

I am an architect, I'm drawing up the plans

It's like I'm 17, nobody understands
No one understands



He got my heartbeat

Skipping down 16th Avenue

Got that, ah, I mean
Wanna see what's under that attitude like
I want you, bless my soul
And I ain't gotta tell him, I think he knows

I think he knows
When we get all alone
I'll make myself at home
And he'll want me to stay

He'd better lock it down
Or I won't stick around
'Cause good ones never wait (Ha)

Lover,7,Miss Americana & The Heartbreak Prince,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-miss-americana-and-the-heartbreak-prince-lyrics,"You know I adore you, I'm crazier for you
Than I was at sixteen, lost in a film scene

Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights

American glory faded before me

Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress

Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life (Ah)



No cameras catch my pageant smile

I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but


It's you and me, that's my whole world

They whisper in the hallway, ""She's a bad, bad girl"" (Okay)

The whole school is rolling fake dice

You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes

It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince (Okay)
We're so sad, we paint the town blue

Voted most likely to run away with you




My team is losing, battered and bruising

I see the high fives between the bad guys

Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care

American stories burning before me

I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?

Darling, I'm scared (Ah)


No cameras catch my muffled cries

I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but


It's you and me, that's my whole world

Lover,8,Paper Rings,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-paper-rings-lyrics,"The moon is high
Like your friends were the night that we first met

Went home and tried to stalk you on the internet

Now I've read all of the books beside your bed

The wine is cold

Like the shoulder that I gave you in the street
Cat and mouse for a month or two or three

Now I wake up in the night and watch you breathe



(Ayy)
Kiss me once 'cause you know I had a long night (Oh)
Kiss me twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)

Three times 'cause I waited my whole life (One, two, one, two, three, four)



I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want, and

I hate accidents, except when we went from friends to this
Uh-huh, that's right
Darling, you're the one I want

In paper rings, in picture frames, in dirty dreams

Oh, you're the one I want




In the winter, in the icy outdoor pool
When you jumped in first, I went in too

I'm with you even if it makes me blue

Which takes me back
To the color that we painted your brother's wall

Honey, without all the exes, fights and flaws
We wouldn't be standing here so tall, so



(Ayy)
Kiss you once 'cause I know you had a long night (Oh)
Kiss you twice 'cause it's gonna be alright (Uh)

I want to drive away with you

I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays

Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
I want to drive away with you

I want your complications too
I want your dreary Mondays

Wrap your arms around me, baby boy
Uh-huh


I like shiny things, but I'd marry you with paper rings
Ah-ah, that's right, you're the one I want

Lover,9,Cornelia Street,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-cornelia-street-lyrics,"We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar

""I rent a place on Cornelia Street""

I say casually in the car

We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go

As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
Leading us home



And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again



Windows flung right open, autumn air

Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours

We bless the rains on Cornelia Street

Memorize the creaks in the floor

Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on

I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone



But then you called, showed your hand

I turned around before I hit the tunnel

Sat on the roof, you and I



I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again




You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside

Barefoot in the kitchen

Sacred new beginnings
That became my religion, listen



I hope I never lose you

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

Oh, never again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name (City screams your name)

And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again




I don't wanna lose you (Hope it never ends)

I'd never walk Cornelia Street again

I don't wanna lose you (Yeah)

I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent



They say, ""Home is where the heart is""
But that's not where mine lives


You know I love a London boy

I enjoy walkin' Camden Market in the afternoon

He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet

Darling, I fancy you

Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates

So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy

Boy, I fancy you (Ooh)



And now I love high tea, stories from Uni' and the West End

You can find me in the pub, we are watchin' rugby with his school friends

Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride

Babes, don't threaten me with a good time




They say, ""Home is where the heart is""
But, God, I love the English



You know I love a London boy

I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon

He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet

Darling, I fancy you

Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy

Wanna be with you, oh, woah

I enjoy walkin' Soho, drinkin' in the afternoon (Yeah)

He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet

Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates

Lover,13,False God,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-false-god-lyrics,"“False God” uses heavy religious imagery to compare Swift’s relationship with her then boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, to something all-powerful and greater than themselves.

We were crazy to think

Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?

We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us

Remember how I’d fly to you?


And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City

I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this

They say the road gets hard and you get lost

When you're led by blind faith, blind faith



But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
We’d still worship this love




I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey

Hell is when I fight with you

But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness

Got the wine for you



And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you

You're the West Village

You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this

They say the road gets hard and you get lost

When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith


But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah




Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love"

Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
But you say it in a Tweet, that's a cop-out

And I'm just like, ""Hey, are you okay?""


And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression

But I've learned a lesson that stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun

And snakes and stones never broke my bones



So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
You need to calm down



You are somebody that we don't know
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
Why are you mad when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)

Sunshine on the street at the parade
But you would rather be in the dark ages
Makin' that sign must've taken all night




You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace

And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay



So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh (Oh)

You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?

You need to calm down



And we see you over there on the internet
Comparing all the girls who are killing it
But we figured you out
We all know now we all got crowns

You need to calm down



Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)

Chemistry 'til it blows up, 'til there’s no us

It's so excruciating to see you low
Just wanna lift you up and not let you go
This ultraviolet morning light below
Tells me this love is worth the fight, oh




I lived like an island, punished you with silence

Went off like sirens, just crying

I've been sleepin' so long in a twenty-year dark night

And now I see daylight, I only see daylight



Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
And so I became the butt of the joke
I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
Clearin' the air, I breathed in the smoke



Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down

Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town

Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
It's brighter now, now



I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you

I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you

Midnights,2,Maroon,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-maroon-lyrics,"When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again

Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend

""How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?"" you say
""Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how""

I see you every day now



And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes

Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me

And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon



When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?

You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway

Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us

I feel you, no matter what

The rubies that I gave up




And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes

Looked up at the sky and it was (Maroon)
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me

And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was (Maroon)
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon



And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy (It was maroon)
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave



The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me

And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon




It was maroon
It was maroon"
Midnights,3,Anti-Hero,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-anti-hero-lyrics,"I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser

Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift
, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room



I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis

(Tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
(For the last time)



It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me

At teatime, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero



Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby

And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city

Pierced through the heart, but never killed




Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?

(A tale as old as time)

I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
(For the last time)



It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

At teatime, everybody agrees

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero



I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
""She's laughing up at us from Hell""



It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi
I'm the problem, it's me
It's me, hi

Everybody agrees, everybody agrees




It's me, hi (Hi)
I'm the problem, it's me (I'm the problem, it's me)

At teatime (Teatime), everybody agrees (Everybody agrees)

I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror

It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero"
Midnights,4,"You're On Your Own, Kid",https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-youre-on-your-own-kid-lyrics,"Summer went away, still, the yearning stays

I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me

It's okay, we're the best of friends
Anyway
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
All my days



From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes

I waited ages to see you there

I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared



You're on your own, kid
You always have been



I see the great escape,
 so long, Daisy May

I picked the petals, he loves me not

Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
I'll run away




From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there

I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare



You're on your own, kid
You always have been






From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this

I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss

The jokes weren't funny
, I took the money

My friends from home don't know what to say

I looked around in a blood-soaked gown

And I saw something they can't take away

'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned

Everything you lose is a step you take

So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid




You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been"
Midnights,6,Midnight Rain,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-midnight-rain-lyrics,"Rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name

Chasing that fame, he stayed the same

All of me changed like midnight


My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders

But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean

I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain


He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name

Chasing that fame, he stayed the same

All of me changed like midnight


It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
Holiday peppermint candy
But for him, it's every day

So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel

And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain



He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name

Chasing that fame, he stayed the same

All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain

He wanted a bride, I was making my own name

Chasing that fame, he stayed the same

All of me changed like midnight


I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted

And he never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV

I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted

And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this
(Midnights like this, midnights like this)"

Good girl, sad boy
Big city, wrong choices

We had one thing goin' on
I swear that it was somethin'

'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since

But one thing after another
Fuckin' situations, circumstances
Miscommunications, and I

Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations


Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room

And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you

But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh

When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question



Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night

But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles

And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray

I just may like to have a conversation


Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room

And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you

But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question


Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?

That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight



Can I ask you a question? (Can I ask you a question?)
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room (In a crowded room)

And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you (Makin' fun of you)

But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do? (Do)
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh

I don't dress for women

Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge



I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends

Don't get sad, get even

So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge


She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride

Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife



And she looks so pretty
Drivin' in your Benz

Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge




She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even

So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge


Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough



While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine

Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI



And I don't dress for villains
Or for innocents

I'm on my vigilante shit again

I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings

Outside, they’re push and shovin'

Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, ""You should be doing more""
To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it

At the same time

Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose


What if I told you none of it was accidental?

And the first night that you saw me

Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line

What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine

It was all by dеsign

'Cause I'm a mastermind


You see, all the wisеst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game




If you fail to plan, you plan to fail

Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails


What if I told you none of it was accidental?

And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
Just like clockwork
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design

'Cause I'm a mastermind




No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless

This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
And I swear
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian

'Cause I care



So I told you none of it was accidental

And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me

And I'll never

You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball

Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes



So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong

Wе learn to live with the pain, mosaic brokеn hearts

We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place

That magic's not here no more

And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

'Causе there we arе again on that little town street

You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me

Wind in my hair, I was there

I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed

And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the
 tee-ball team

You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town

And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now

He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame




And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do

And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to



'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath

Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation
, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest

I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here

'Cause I remember it all, all, all




They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell

Every time you double-cross my mind

You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?

A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you

Not weepin' in a party bathroom

Some actress askin' me what happened, you

That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes

Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show

But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come

And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""



Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week

'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me

You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well



And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes

""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""

From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones

I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?

Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well



Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well

Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there

It was rare, you remember it"

I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet

Sometimes, you wonder 'bout me



And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you

And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do



I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye



And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you

And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do




Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do



And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you

And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do

Remember how that lasted for a day?
I say, ""I hate you,"" we break up, you call me, ""I love you""

And me falling for it, screaming that I'm right
And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away

This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said



Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me

But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing

And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay



You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams

I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life



Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

Red,11,Holy Ground,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-holy-ground-lyrics,"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away

Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme

Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day



And darling, it was good
Never looking down

And right there where we stood
Was holy ground



Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress

We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose

And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd




'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down

And right there where we stood
Was holy ground



Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you




It was good
Never looking down

And right there where we stood
Was holy ground



Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you"

Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait



We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair



In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities

And time is taking its sweet time erasing you

And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me



'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair



Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?

Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we can't get back




A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful



What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"

In the angel's city, chasin' fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool

So overnight, you look like a '60s queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky


And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh



And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views

And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you

And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused

'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place




Another name goes up in lights

You wonder if you'll make it out alive



And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh



It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out

They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now



'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right



Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one

Picked me up, late one night out the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""

But you got here early and you stand and wave

I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do


And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end

But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again


You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
But I do

We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do



But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end

But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again


And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past



'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

Busy streets and busy lives

We are alone with our changing minds

We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time



And I never

And I'll never
Be the same



You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball

Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes



So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong

Wе learn to live with the pain, mosaic brokеn hearts

But this love is brave and wild



I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same



This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight

Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate

You're my Achilles heel

This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real

We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place

Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed

And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the
 tee-ball team

You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town

And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now

He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave

There was nothing else I could do

And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to



'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath

Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation
, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest

I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here

'Cause I remember it all, all, all




They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell

Every time you double-cross my mind

You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?

A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you

Not weepin' in a party bathroom

Some actress askin' me what happened, you

That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes

Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show

But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come

And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""



Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week

'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me

You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well



And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes

""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""

From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones

I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?

Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well



Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well

Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there

It was rare, you remember it"

I bet you’re tired from a long, hard week
I bet you’re sittin' in your chair by the window
Looking out at the city, and I bet

Sometimes, you wonder 'bout me



And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you

And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do



I bet you think I either moved on or hate you
‘Cause each time you reach out, there’s no reply
I bet it never, ever occurred to you
That I can’t say hello to you and risk another goodbye



And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you

And I hope you know that
Every time I don’t, I almost do, I almost do




Oh, we made quite a mess, babe
It’s probably better off this way
And I confess, babe
In my dreams, you’re touching my face
And asking me if I want to try again with you
And I almost do



And I just wanna tell you
It takes everything in me not to call you
And I wish I could run to you

And I hope you know that

And you would hide away and find your peace of mind
With some indie record that's much cooler than mine

I threw my phone across the room, at you
I was expecting some dramatic turn away

This morning, I said we should talk about it
'Cause I read you should never leave a fight unresolved
That's when you came in wearing a football helmet
And said, ""Okay, let's talk""
And I said



Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

But I think that it's best if we both stay


Before you, I'd only dated self-indulgent takers
Who took all of their problems out on me

But you carry my groceries and now, I'm always laughing

And I love you because you have given me
No choice but to


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay, stay, stay



You took the time to memorize me
My fears, my hopes, and dreams

I just like hanging out with you all the time
All those times that you didn't leave, it's been occurring to me
I'd like to hang out with you for my whole life



Stay and I'll be loving you for quite some time
No one else is gonna love me when I get mad, mad, mad
So I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!


Stay, stay, stay
I've been loving you for quite some time, time, time
You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad
But I think that it's best if we both stay, stay
Stay, stay, stay, stay!

You think that it's funny when I'm mad, mad, mad

Red (Taylor's Version),11,Holy Ground (Taylor's Version),https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-holy-ground-lyrics,"I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away

Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme

Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day



And darling, it was good
Never looking down

And right there where we stood
Was holy ground



Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress

We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, ""I need you""
And for the first time, I had something to lose

And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd




'Cause darling, it was good
Never looking down

And right there where we stood
Was holy ground



Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you




It was good
Never looking down

And right there where we stood
Was holy ground



Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you"

Words, how little they mean when you're a little too late
I stood right by the tracks, your face in a locket
Good girls, hopeful they'll be and long they will wait



We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair



In dreams, I meet you in warm conversation
We both wake in lonely beds, different cities

And time is taking its sweet time erasing you

And you've got your demons, and darling, they all look like me



'Cause we had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair



Distance, timing
Breakdown, fighting
Silence, the train runs off its tracks
Kiss me, try to fix it
Could you just try to listen?

Hang up, give up
And for the life of us we can't get back




A beautiful, magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic
Beautiful, tragic, beautiful



What we had, a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic, love affair
We had a beautiful magic love there
What a sad, beautiful, tragic love affair"

In the angel's city, chasin' fortune and fame
And the camera flashes make it look like a dream

You had it figured out since you were in school
Everybody loves pretty, everybody loves cool

So overnight, you look like a '60s queen


Another name goes up in lights
Like diamonds in the sky


And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
But can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh



And now, it's big black cars and Riviera views

And your lover in the foyer doesn't even know you

And your secrets end up splashed on the news front page
And they tell you that you're lucky, but you're so confused

'Cause you don't feel pretty, you just feel used
And all the young things line up to take your place




Another name goes up in lights

You wonder if you'll make it out alive



And they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Can you tell me now, you're the lucky one?
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh



It was a few years later, I showed up here
And they still tell the legend of how you disappeared
How you took the money and your dignity and got the hell out

They say you bought a bunch of land somewhere
Chose the rose garden over Madison Square
And it took some time, but I understand it now



'Cause now my name is up in lights
But I think you got it right



Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Let me tell you now, you're the lucky one
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one
Yeah, they'll tell you now, you're the lucky one

I met Bobby on the boardwalk, summer of '45
Picked me up, late one night out the window
We were 17 and crazy, running wild, wild
Can't remember what song it was playing when we walked in
The night we snuck into a yacht club party
Pretending to be a duchess and a prince

The whole place was dressed to the nines
And we were dancing, dancing

Like we're made of starlight, starlight
Like we're made of starlight, starlight

You'll spend your whole life singing the blues if you keep thinking that way""
He was trying to skip rocks on the ocean, saying to me
""Don't you see the starlight, starlight?
Don't you dream impossible things?""

Ooh-ooh, dancing with me
Ooh-ooh, we could get married
Have ten kids and teach 'em how to dream

But you got here early and you stand and wave

I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
But I do


And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end

But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again


You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you

We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But I do

I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end

But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again


And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past



'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid

I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did

A million little shining stars had just aligned
And I would've been so happy



Christmas lights glisten
I've got my eye on the door
Just waiting for you to walk in
But the time is ticking
People ask me how I've been
As I comb back through my memory
How you said you'd be here
You said you'd be here



And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
As I'm looking around the room
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew




And the hours pass by
Now I just wanna be alone
But your close friends always seem to know
When there's something really wrong
So they follow me down the hall

And there in the bathroom
I try not to fall apart
And the sinking feeling starts
As I say hopelessly
""He said he'd be here""



And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all laughing
And asking me about you
But there was one thing missing (Missing)

What do you say
When tears are streaming down your face
In front of everyone you know?
And what do you do
When the one who means the most to you
Is the one who didn't show?




You should've been here
And I would've been so happy



And it was like slow motion
Standing there in my party dress
In red lipstick
With no one to impress
And they're all standing around me, singing
""Happy birthday to you""
But there was one thing missing
And that was the moment I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, I knew
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

How strange that I don't know you at all
Stumbled through the long goodbye
One last kiss, then catch your flight
Right when I was just about to fall



I told myself, don't get attached
But in my mind, I play it back
Spinning faster than the plane that took you


And this is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this
Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in New York today

I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


The delicate beginning rush
The feeling you can know so much
Without knowing anything at all

And now that I can put this down
If I had known what I know now
I never would've played so nonchalant




Taxi cabs and busy streets
That never bring you back to me
I can't help but wish you took me with you



And this is when the feeling sinks in

Come back, be here, come back, be here
I guess you're in London today

And I don't wanna need you this way
Come back, be here, come back, be here


This is falling in love in the cruelest way
This is falling for you when you are worlds away
In New York, be here
But you're in London, and I break down
'Cause it's not fair that you're not around



This is when the feeling sinks in
I don't wanna miss you like this

Busy streets and busy lives

And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds

We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds or fades in time



And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same



You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball

Now all we know is don't let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes



So you were never a saint and I loved in shades of wrong

Wе learn to live with the pain, mosaic brokеn hearts

But this love is brave and wild



I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never
Be the same



This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight

Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate

You're my Achilles heel

This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real


And I never
Saw you comin'
And I'll never

I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man

And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy

Remember I leaned in and whispered to you



""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here

You were my best four years""



I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, ""Why?""
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died

And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here

I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear




""Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
We'll just disappear
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here

You were my best four years""

Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me

I love you to the moon and back"

Than lovin’ a man who didn't know what he had when he had it

And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic



I wish it wasn't 4AM, standin’ in the mirror
Saying to myself, ""You know you had to do it""

I know the bravest thing I ever did was run



Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand

But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man


I know I'm probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind at any given minute
And it was always on your terms, I waited on every careless word

Hoping they might turn sweet again like it was in the beginning


But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now

Talking down to me like I'd always be around

Push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I'd run




Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand

But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man


I hold onto this pride because, these days, it's all I have
And I gave to you my best

And we both know you can't say that


I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would've become if you were a better man
We might still be in love if you were a better man
You would've been the one if you were a better man



Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again

But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
A better man

Forever winter if you go

I pull at every thread trying to solve the puzzles in his head

I miss you like it was the very first night



And so it goes

Every weekend, this same party
I never go alone
And I don't seem broken-hearted
My friends all say they know
Everything I'm going through

I drive down different roads
But they all lead back to you



'Cause they don't know about the night in the hotel
They weren't ridin' in the car when we both fell

Didn't read the note on the Polaroid picture

They don't know how much I miss you


I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky

I miss you like it was the very first night



And so it was
We never saw it comin'
Not trying to fall in love

But we did like children runnin'

Back then, we didn't know
We were built to fall apart

We broke the status quo

Then we broke each other's hearts


But don't forget about the night out in LA

Dance in the kitchen, chase me down through the hallway

No one knows about the words that we whispered
No one knows how much I miss you



I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time
I'd write this in the sky
I miss you like it was the very first night


Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you
Take me away, take me away
Take me away to you, to you




I remember the night at the hotel
I was ridin' in the car when we both fell
I'm the one on the phone as you whisper

""Do you know how much I miss you?""


I wish that we could go back in time
And I'd say to you
""I miss you like it was the very first night""


I wish I could fly
I'd pick you up and we'd go back in time

But somethin' 'bout it felt like home somehow

And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now



Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singin' in the car, getting lost upstate

Autumn leaves fallin' down like pieces into place

And I can picture it after all these days



And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more

And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all

Oh, oh, oh


'Causе there we arе again on that little town street

You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me

Wind in my hair, I was there

I remember it all too well


Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turnin' red

You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed

And your mother's tellin' stories 'bout you on the
 tee-ball team

You taught me 'bout your past, thinkin' your future was me

And you were tossing me the car keys, ""Fuck the patriarchy""
Keychain on the ground, we were always skippin' town

And I was thinkin' on the drive down, ""Any time now

He's gonna say it's love,"" you never called it what it was

'Til we were dead and gone and buried
Check the pulse and come back swearin' it's the same
After three months in the grave
And then you wondered where it went to as I reached for you
But all I felt was shame and you held my lifeless frame




And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do

And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to



'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancin' 'round the kitchen in the refrigerator light

Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well
And there we are again when nobody had to know
You kept me like a secret, but I kept you like an oath

Sacred prayer and we'd swear
To remember it all too well, yeah


Well, maybe we got lost in translation
, maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece 'til you tore it all up
Runnin' scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of bein' honest

I'm a crumpled-up piece of paper lyin' here

'Cause I remember it all, all, all




They say all's well that ends well, but I'm in a new hell

Every time you double-cross my mind

You said if we had been closer in age, maybe it would've been fine
And that made me want to die

The idea you had of me, who was she?

A never-needy, ever-lovely jewel whose shine reflects on you

Not weepin' in a party bathroom

Some actress askin' me what happened, you

That's what happened, you
You who charmed my dad with self-effacing jokes

Sippin' coffee like you're on a late-night show

But then he watched me watch the front door all night, willin' you to come

And he said, ""It's supposed to be fun turning twenty-one""



Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it

I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still tryin' to find it

After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now you mail back my things and I walk home alone

But you keep my old scarf from that very first week

'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me

You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah


'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all

It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well



And I was never good at tellin' jokes, but the punch line goes

""I'll get older, but your lovers stay my age""

From when your Brooklyn broke my skin and bones

I'm a soldier who's returning half her weight

And did the twin flame bruise paint you blue?

Just between us, did the love affair maim you too?

'Cause in this city's barren cold
I still remember the first fall of snow
And how it glistened as it fell
I remember it all too well



Just between us, did the love affair maim you all too well?
Just between us, do you remember it all too well?
Just between us, I remember it (Just between us) all too well

Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there (Oh)
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there (I was there)
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it (All too well)
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there
It was rare, you remember it
Wind in my hair, I was there, I was there
Down the stairs, I was there, I was there
Sacred prayer, I was there, I was there

It was rare, you remember it"

Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts

The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

You are the best thing that's ever been mine



Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place

You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes




But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take

As everything was slipping right out of our hands

I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known

You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""

Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night
""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you

Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call

Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall




And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind

You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time


I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile

So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand



But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time



All the time"
Speak Now,4,Speak Now,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-speak-now-lyrics,"I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry


This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""



Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be



She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen

But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""

Don't say yes, run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow (Say a single vow)
Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""



Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh


I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you




I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha



So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, ""Speak now""

And you say, ""Let's run away now (Run away now)
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows (Say a single vow)
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"""
Speak Now,5,Dear John,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-dear-john-lyrics,"Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you

Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain

And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday

Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known



Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""




Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong

Don't you think nineteen's too young

To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known



You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests

All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out

But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh, oh



Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known




You should've known
Don't you think I was too young?
You should've known"
Speak Now,6,Mean,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-mean-lyrics,"You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me

You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing

You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard

Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man



Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know


Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?



You, with your switching sides

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation

You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you

I just wanna feel okay again



I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know


Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?



And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things

Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean


All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic

And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean



But someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

(Why you gotta be so mean?)
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
(Why you gotta be so mean?)

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, ""They’re the lucky ones""
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
’Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on



Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout

So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through



Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I’m dyin’ to know, is it killin' you
Like it’s killin' me? Yeah

I don't know what to say since thе twist of fate
When it all broke down
And thе story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


Next chapter




How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin’ to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me



Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud



Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now

But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight




So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon


Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah

Speak Now,8,Never Grow Up,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-never-grow-up-lyrics,"Your little hand's wrapped around my finger
And it's so quiet in the world tonight
Your little eyelids flutter 'cause you're dreaming
So I tuck you in, turn on your favourite nightlight



To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart

And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up


Never grow up


You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots



But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred

And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up


Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone


So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on




Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
Won't let no one break your heart

Please, try to never grow up

Speak Now,9,Enchanted,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-enchanted-lyrics,"There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy

Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you



Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""

Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me

The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you



This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you



The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?

I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say

""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""

All I know is I was enchanted to meet you




This night is sparklin', don't you let it go

I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck,
 dancing around all alone

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you



This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends

My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again

These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon

I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)



This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless (Please, don't be in love with someone else)
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck (Please, don't have somebody waiting on you)

Dancing around all alone

Speak Now,10,Better Than Revenge,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-better-than-revenge-lyrics,"Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did (Ha)

Haha, time for a little revenge


The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it

I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from



She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha


She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

(Think about what you did)



She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha


I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word

Woah, woah-ah-oh


She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge



Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh (No, no, no, no)
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? (No)
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause (Come on, come on)
Come on, show me how much better you are

See, you deserve some applause

Left yourself in your war path

Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back

Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?



It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
You're still an innocent



Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again

You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then


Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?




It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did

You're still an innocent


Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh



It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent

It's okay, life is a tough crowd

He will try to take away my pain
And he just might make me smile
But the whole time, I'm wishing he was you instead

Speak Now,13,Last Kiss,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-last-kiss-lyrics,"I still remember the look on your face
Lit through the darkness at 1:58
The words that you whispered for just us to know
You told me you loved me, so why did you go away?
Away



I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart

It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms


But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss



I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips



I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again

And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something

There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions




And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss



I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh



So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep

And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe

And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are


And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed

You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind



So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss




I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips



Just like our last kiss
Forever the name on my lips
Forever the name on my lips

Just like our last"
Speak Now,14,Long Live,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-long-live-lyrics,"I said, ""Remember this moment""
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild

We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age



Long live the walls we crashed through

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders

One day, we will be remembered


I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world



Long live the walls we crashed through

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved

I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you

I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day

When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you



Long, long live the walls we crashed through

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"
Speak Now (Taylor's Version),1,Mine (Taylor's Version),https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-mine-lyrics,"Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh


You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts



I say, ""Can you believe it?""
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now



Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

You are the best thing that's ever been mine



Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place

You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes




But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about


Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

You are the best thing that's ever been mine

Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time

You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter

You are the best thing that's ever been mine



Oh-oh, oh-oh


And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands

I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, ""I'll never leave you alone""




You said, ""I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine""


Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
(Hold on) You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter (Make it last)

(Hold on) You are the best thing that's ever been mine (Hold on)



Yes, yes, do you believe it? (Hold on)
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now (Hold on)
Yes, yes, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now"
Speak Now (Taylor's Version),2,Sparks Fly (Taylor's Version),https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-sparks-fly-lyrics,"The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards

You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far

And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch

Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile



My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea

You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be

I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good

And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would


Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile




I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show



Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk (Ah-ah), take away the pain

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile

Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around

'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile



And the sparks fly
Oh, baby, smile
And the sparks fly"

How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why


Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die



So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night
""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you

Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time


These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call

Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughin' from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall




And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind

You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye


So, this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time


I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile

So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry

Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
Probably mindless dreaming
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand



But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', ""I'm sorry for that night""
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine

I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

Who should be marrying the wrong girl

I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry


This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, ""Speak now""



Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be



She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen

But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?


Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out

Your time is running out
And they said, ""Speak now""



Ooh (Run away now), la
Ooh (Say a single vow), ooh


I hear the preacher say
""Speak now or forever hold your peace""
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you




I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha



So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out

Speak Now (Taylor's Version),5,Dear John (Taylor's Version),https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-dear-john-lyrics,"Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you

Counting my footsteps
Praying the floor won't fall through again

And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine

You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain

And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday

Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why


Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I should've known



Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away

And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
Who don't understand
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
""Run as fast as you can""




Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong

Don't you think nineteen's too young

To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
I should've known



You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests

All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out

But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Oh, oh



Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home

I see it all now that you're gone

Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?

The girl in the dress wrote you a song
You should've known

And swords and weapons that you use against me

You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing

You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard

Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man



Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know


Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?



You, with your switching sides

And your wildfire lies and your humiliation

You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you

I just wanna feel okay again



I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know


Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?



And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion
But nobody's listening
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things

Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing

But all you are is mean


All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic

And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean



But someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?

Someday, I'll be livin' in a big ole city

And all you're ever gonna be is mean

Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me

I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now I'm searchin' the room for an empty seat
’Cause lately I don't even know what page you're on



Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout

So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through



Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I’m dyin’ to know, is it killin' you
Like it’s killin' me? Yeah

I don't know what to say since thе twist of fate
When it all broke down
And thе story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


Next chapter




How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and tryin’ to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think one day I'll tell the story of us
How I was losin' my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me



Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud



Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'

When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now


This is looking like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now

But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight




So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon


Now I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know, is it killin' you
Like it's killin' me? Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now, now, now

To you, everything's funny
You got nothing to regret
I'd give all I have, honey
If you could stay like that


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you
Won't let no one break your heart

And no one will desert you
Just try to never grow up


Never grow up


You're in the car, on the way to the movies
And you're mortified your mom's dropping you off
At fourteen, there's just so much you can't do
And you can't wait to move out someday and call your own shots



But don't make her drop you off around the block
Remember that she's gettin' older, too
And don't lose the way that you dance around
In your PJs getting ready for school


Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
No one's ever burned you
Nothing's ever left you scarred

And even though you want to
Just try to never grow up


Take pictures in your mind of your childhood room
Memorize what it sounded like when your dad gets home
Remember the footsteps, remember the words said
And all your little brother's favorite songs
I just realized everything I have is, someday, gonna be gone


So, here I am in my new apartment
In a big city, they just dropped me off
It's so much colder than I thought it would be
So I tuck myself in and turn my nightlight on




Wish I'd never grown up
I wish I'd never grown up
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, I could still be little
Oh, I don't wanna grow up
Wish I'd never grown up, it could still be simple

Oh, darling, don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, just stay this little
Oh, darlin', don't you ever grow up
Don't you ever grow up, it could stay this simple
I won't let nobody hurt you (Never grow up)
Won't let no one break your heart

Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Walls of insincerity
Shifting eyes and vacancy

Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you



Your eyes whispered, ""Have we met?""

Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me

The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you



This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you



The lingering question kept me up
2 a.m., who do you love?

I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say

""Hey, it was enchanting to meet you""

All I know is I was enchanted to meet you




This night is sparklin', don't you let it go

I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck,
 dancing around all alone

I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you



This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends

My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again

These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon

I was enchanted to meet you

Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else (Ooh)
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you (Ooh, oh)

She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say ""Sabotage""

I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it

I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from



She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends

She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha


She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things

But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity

I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word

Woah, woah-ah-oh


She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah (She deserved it)

Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again

You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then


Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?

Away



I do recall now, the smell of the rain
Fresh on the pavement
, I ran off the plane
That July ninth, the beat of your heart

It jumps through your shirt, I can still feel your arms


But now I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss



I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips



I do remember the swing of your step
The life of the party, you're showing off again

And I'd roll my eyes and then you'd pull me in
I'm not much for dancing, but for you, I did

Because I love your handshake, meeting my father
I love how you walk with your hands in your pockets
How you'd kiss me when I was in the middle of saying something

There's not a day I don't miss those rude interruptions




And I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss



I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips, ooh



So I'll watch your life in pictures like I used to watch you sleep

And I feel you forget me like I used to feel you breathe

And I'll keep up with our old friends just to ask them how you are
Hope it's nice where you are


And I hope the sun shines and it's a beautiful day
And something reminds you you wish you had stayed

You can plan for a change in the weather and time
But I never planned on you changing your mind



So, I'll go
Sit on the floor wearing your clothes

All that I know is I don't know
How to be something you miss




I never thought we'd have a last kiss
I never imagined we'd end like this

Your name, forever the name on my lips

And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same

You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age



Long live the walls we crashed through

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders

One day, we will be remembered


I said, ""Remember this feeling""
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town

And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, ""This is absurd""
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world



Long live the walls we crashed through

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved

I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you

I was screaming, ""Long live that look on your face""
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered


Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall

Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day

When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine

Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you



Long, long live the walls we crashed through

How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you

And I was screaming, ""Long live all the magic we made""
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, ""Long live all the mountains we moved""
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered"
Speak Now (Taylor's Version),15,Ours (Taylor's Version),https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-ours-lyrics,"“Ours” is a track on the deluxe edition of Taylor Swift’s 2010 album Speak Now. Like her song “Love Story,” it tells the tale of a love frowned upon by others.

Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs

If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you

And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you



So don't you worry your pretty little mind

People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough

But this love is ours



You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles

But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
And you'll say


Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours



And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak

And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours



So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
And don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours"

He puts papers in his briefcase and drives away
To save the world or go to work
It's the same thing to me
He's got his mother's eyes, his father's ambition

I wonder if he knows how much that I miss him
I hang on every word you say, yay
And you smile and say, ""How are you?”
I say, ""Just fine""
I always forget to tell you, I love you
I love you forever


I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
And I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down



Tall, dark and beautiful

He's complicated, he's irrational

But I hope someday you'll take me away and save the day, yeah
Something in his deep brown eyes has me sayin'
He's not all bad like his reputation
And I can't hear one single word they say

And you'll leave, got places to be and I'll be okay
I always forget to tell you I love you
I loved you from the very first day




I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
I watch superman fly away
Come back, I'll be with you someday

I'll be right here on the ground
When you come back down



And I watch you fly around the world

And I hope you don't save some other girl
Don't forget, don't forget about me
I'm far away, but I never let you go
I'm love-struck and looking out the window

Don't forget, don't forget where I'll be

Right here, wishing the flowers were from you
Wishing the card was from you
Wishing the call was from you

'Cause I loved you from the very first day



I watch superman fly away
You've got a busy day today
Go save the world, I'll be around
Forever and ever here
I watch superman fly away
I swear, I'll be with you someday
I'll be right here on the ground

And you don't think I, I, I can see ya, do ya?

I’ve been watchin' you for ages
And I spend my time tryin' not to feel it


But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?

What would you do if we never made a sound?


’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me
And I could see you up against the wall with me
And what would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you



I-I-I-I


And we kept everything professional
But something's changed, it's somethin' I, I like
They keep watchful eyes on us
So it's best that we move fast and keep quiet

You won't believe half the things I see inside my head
Wait 'til you see half the things that haven’t happened yet




But what would you do if I went to touch you now?
What would you do if they never found us out?
What would you do if we never made a sound?


’Cause I can see you waitin' down the hall from me

I could see you make me want you even more
What would you do? Baby, if you only knew
That I can see you



I-I-I-I



I can see you in your suit and your necktie
Passed me a note sayin’, ""Meet me tonight""

Then we kiss and you know I won't ever tell, yeah

And I could see you being my addiction
You can see me as a secret mission

Hide away and I will start behaving myself

Chances are, tonight, you've already got plans
And chances are I will talk myself to sleep again
You give me just enough attention to keep my hopes too high

Wishful thoughts forget to mention when something's really not right

And I will block out these voices of reason in my head



And the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson""



Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love

That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down


You know how to keep me waitin'
I know how to act like I'm fine

Don't know what to call this situation

But I know I can't call you mine

And it's delicate, but I will do my best to seem bulletproof

'Cause when my head is on your shoulder
It starts thinkin' you'll come around
And maybe, someday, when we're older
This is something we'll laugh about

Over coffee every mornin' while you're watching the news



But then the voices say, ""You are not the exception
You will never learn your lesson""

Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will learn the hard way instead of just walkin' out


Now I'm slidin' down the wall with my head in my hands
Sayin', ""How could I not see the signs?""

Oh, you haven't written me or called

But goodbye screamin' in the silence
And the voices in my head are tellin' me why
'Cause you got her on your arm and me in the wings
I'll get your longing glances, but she'll get your ring

And you will say you had the best of intentions
And maybe I will finally learn my lesson


Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come
You will take the long way, you will take the long way down
Foolish one
Stop checkin' your mailbox for confessions of love
That ain't never gonna come

Ain't never gonna come
Ooh, you will learn the hard way now
Foolish one
Sittin' 'round waiting for confessions of love
They ain't never gonna come
And thinkin' he's the one, you should've been walkin' out
Foolish one
The day is gonna come for your confessions of love

Speak Now (Taylor's Version),22,Timeless (Taylor's Version) (From The Vault),https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-timeless-taylors-version-from-the-vault-lyrics,"Down the block, there's an antique shop
And something in my head said, ""Stop,"" so I walked in
On the counter was a cardboard box
And the sign said, ""Photos: twenty-five cents each""
Black and white, saw a 30s bride
And school lovers laughin' on the porch of their first house
The kinda love that you only find once in a lifetime
The kind you don't put down


And that's when I called you and it's so hard to explain
But in those photos, I saw us instead
And, somehow, I know that you and I would've found each other
In another life, you still would've turned my head even if wе'd met


On a crowded street in 1944
And you werе headed off to fight in the war

You still would've been mine

We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And prayed to God you'd be comin' home all right
And you would've been fine
We would have been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless



I had to smile when it caught my eye
There was one of a teenage couple in the driveway
Holdin' hands on the way to a dance
And the date on the back said 1958
Which brought me back to the first time I saw you
Time stood still like somethin' in this old shop

I thought about it as I started lookin' 'round
At these precious things that time forgot


That's when I came upon a book covered in cobwebs

Story of a romance torn apart by fate
Hundreds of years ago, they fell in love, like we did
And I'd die for you in the same way if I first saw your face



In the 1500s, off in a foreign land

And I was forced to marry another man

You still would've been mine
We would have been timeless
I would've read your love letters every single night
And run away and left it all behind
You still would've been mine
We would've been timeless
'Cause I believe that we were supposed to find this
So, even in a different life, you still would've been mine
We would've been timeless



Time breaks down your mind and body
Don't you let it touch your soul
It was like an age-old classic
The first time that you saw me
The story started when you said, ""Hello""


In a crowded room a few short years ago

And sometimes there's no proof, you just know

You're always gonna be mine
We're gonna be
I'm gonna love you when our hair is turnin' gray
We'll have a cardboard box of photos of the life we've made
And you'll say, ""Oh my, we really were timeless""



We're gonna be timeless, timeless
You still would've been mine
We would've been
Even if we'd met on a crowded street in 1944
You still would've been mine
We would've been

Taylor Swift,1,Tim McGraw,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-tim-mcgraw-lyrics,"He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie""

Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night



And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone



But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me


September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that

But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back




It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe


When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me


And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read



Is, ""When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song

Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place""

When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans

When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me



Oh, think of me, mmm

Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, ""That's a lie"""

That's fine, you won't mind if I say
By the way


I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time
As far as I'm concerned, you're just another picture to burn


Therе's no time for tears
I'm just sitting herе planning my revenge
There's nothing stopping me
From going out with all of your best friends
And if you come around saying sorry to me
My daddy's gonna show you how sorry you'll be


'Cause I hate that stupid old pickup truck you never let me drive
You're a redneck heartbreak who's really bad at lying
So watch me strike a match on all my wasted time

The kind of flawless I wish I could be

And our mamas smiled and rolled their eyes
And said, ""Oh, my, my, my""



Take me back to the house in the backyard tree

Said you'd beat me up, you were bigger than me

The slamming of doors 'stead of kissing goodnight
You stayed outside 'til the morning light

A few years had gone and come around
We were sitting at our favorite spot in town

And you looked at me, got down on one knee



Take me back to the time when we walked down the aisle
Our whole town came and our mamas cried
You said, ""I do,"" and I did, too

Take me home where we met so many years before
We'll rock our babies on that very front porch

He says, ""Baby, is something wrong?""
I say, ""Nothin', I was just thinkin' how we don't have a song""
And he says



Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss her and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again



I was walking up the front porch steps
After everythin' that day
Had gone all wrong and been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way to my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses

And the note that said



Our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know

And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again



Da-da-da-da




I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song



'Cause our song is a slammin' screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date, ""Man, I didn't kiss him and I should have""
And when I got home, 'fore I said ""Amen""
Askin' God if he could play it again




Play it again, oh, yeah
Oh-oh, yeah


I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song"

All the right guys promised they'd stay

Under bright lights, they withered away
But you bloom

Portofino was on my mind (And I think you know why)



And if your letters ever said, ""Goodbye""




I'd cry my eyes violet, Elizabeth Taylor

Tell me for real, do you think it's forever?

Been number one, but I never had two

And I can't have fun if I can't have— (Uh)
Be my NY whеn Hollywood hates me

You're only as hot as your last hit, baby

Been numbеr one, but I never had two

And I can't have fun if I can't have you



Hey-ey, what could you possibly get for the girl who has everything and nothing all at once?

Babe, I would trade the Cartier for someone to trust
 (Just kidding)

We hit the best booth
 at Musso and Frank's

They say I'm bad news, I just say, ""Thanks""

And you
Look at me like you're hypnotized, and I think you know why




And if you ever leave me high and dry

Pulled up to you in the Jag', turned your rags into gold

The winding road leads to the chateau

""You remind me of a younger me,"" I saw potential




I'll be your father figure,
 I drink that brown liquor

I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger

This love is pure profit, just step into my office

I dry your tears with my sleeve



Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family



I pay the check before it kisses the mahogany grain

Said, ""They wanna see you rise, they don't want you to reign""

I showed you all the tricks of the trade

All I asked for is your loyalty, my dear protégé




I'll be your father figure,
 I drink that brown liquor
I can make deals with the devil because my dick's bigger

This love is pure profit, just step into my office

They'll know your name in the streets



Leave it with me, I protect the family


I saw a change in you 
(I saw a change, saw a change in you)
My dear boy

They don't make loyalty like they used to
 (Not like they used to)
Your thoughtless ambition sparked the ignition
On foolish decisions, which led to misguided visions
That to fulfill your dreams
You had to get rid of me

I protect the family




I was your father figure, we drank that brown liquor
You made a deal with this devil, turns out my dick's bigger

You want a fight? You found it, I got the place surrounded

You'll be sleeping with the fishes before you know you're drowning

Whose portrait's on the mantel?
 Who covered up your scandals?
Mistake my kindness for weakness and find your card cancelled

I was your father figure
, you pulled the wrong trigger

This empire belongs to me



Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me, I protect the family
Leave it with me

Every joke's just trolling and memes

Sad as it seems, apathy is hot

Everybody's cutthroat in the comments

Every single hot take is cold as ice

That was a lie



I have been afflicted by a terminal uniqueness

I've been dying just from trying to seem cool



But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage

But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out

So many traitors

Smooth operators

But I'm never gonna break that vow

I'm nеver gonna leave you now, now, now


You know, thе last time I laughed this hard was
On the trampoline in somebody's backyard
I must've been about eight or nine

That was the night I fell off and broke my arm

Pretty soon, I learned cautious discretion

When your first crush crushes something kind

When I said I don't believe in marriage
That was a lie




Every eldest daughter was the first lamb to the slaughter

So we all dressed up as wolves and we looked fire



But I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage

But I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out

So many traitors

Smooth operators

But I'm never gonna break that vow
I'm never gonna leave you now, now, now



We lie back
A beautiful, beautiful time-lapse
Ferris wheels, kisses, and lilacs
And things I said were dumb
'Cause I thought that I'd never find that
Beautiful, beautiful life that
Shimmers that innocent light back
Like when we were young



Every youngest child felt
They were raised up in the wild
But now you're home




'Cause I'm not a bad bitch
And this isn't savage

And I'm never gonna let you down
I'm never gonna leave you out
So many traitors

Smooth operators

But I'm never gonna break that vow (Never gonna break that vow)

Two graves, one gun

Holding tight to your quiet resentment

So how much sad did you think I had
Did you think I had in me?
How much tragedy?
Just how low did you
Think I'd go 'fore I'd self-implode?
'Fore I'd have to go be free?


You swore that you loved me, but where were the clues?

I died on the altar waitin' for the proof

You sacrificed us to the gods of your bluest days

And I'm just getting color back into my face

I'm just mad as hell 'cause I loved this place for

The Tortured Poets Department,6,But Daddy I Love Him,https://genius.com/Taylor-swift-but-daddy-i-love-him-lyrics,"I forget how the West was won
I forget if this was ever fun

I just learned these people only raise you
To cage you

Sarahs and Hannahs in their Sunday best

Clutchin' their pearls, sighing, ""What a mess""
I just learned these people try and save you
'Cause they hate you


Too high a horse
For a simple girl
To rise above it

They slammed the door
On my whole world
The one thing I wanted



Now I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Scrеamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""

I'm havin' his baby

No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through thе fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses

I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want





Dutiful daughter, all my plans were laid

Tendrils tucked into a woven braid

Growin' up precocious sometimes means
Not growin' up at all

He was chaos, he was revelry

Bedroom eyes like a remedy

Soon enough, the elders had convened
Down at the city hall



""Stay away from her""

The saboteurs
Protested too much

Lord knows the words
We never heard
Just screeching tires and true love


And I'm runnin' with my dress unbuttoned
Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""

I'm havin' his baby
No, I'm not, but you should see your faces
I'm tellin' him to floor it through the fences
No, I'm not coming to my senses
I know he's crazy, but he's the one I want




I'll tell you something right now
I'd rather burn my whole life down
Than listen to one more second of all this bitchin' and moanin'
I'll tell you something 'bout my good name
It's mine alone to disgrace
I don't cater to all these vipers dressed in empath's clothing



God save the most judgmental creeps
Who say they want what's best for me
Sanctimoniously performing soliloquies I'll never see
Thinkin' it can change the beat
Of my heart when he touches me

And counteract the chemistry
And undo the destiny
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's just my choice



There's a lot of people in town that I
Bestow upon my fakest smiles
Scandal does funny things to pride, but brings lovers closer
We came back when the heat died down

Went to my parents and they came around

All the wine moms are still holdin' out, but fuck 'em, it's over




Now I'm dancin' in my dress in the sun and

Even my daddy just loves him

I'm his lady

And, oh my God, you should see your faces
Time, doesn't it give some perspective?
And, no, you can't come to the wedding
I know it's crazy, but he's the one I want



I'll tell you something right now
You ain't gotta pray for me
Me and my wild boy and all of this wild joy
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
If all you want is gray for me
Then it's just white noise, and it's my choice


Screamin', ""But, Daddy, I love him""
I'm having his baby
No, I'm not
But you should see your faces
But, oh my God, you should see your faces
(He was chaos, he was revelry)
(He was chaos, he was revelry)"

Fresh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to

(Fresh out the slammer, oh)


Another summer takin' cover, rolling thunder

He don't understand me

Splintered back in winter
, silent dinners, bitter

He was with her in dreams



Gray and blue and fights and tunnels

Handcuffed to the spell I was under
For just one hour of sunshine

Years of labor, locks, and ceilings

In the shade of how he was feeling
But it's gonna be alright, I did my time



Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin' back home to you

Frеsh out the slammer, I know who my first call will be to
(Frеsh out the slammer, oh)


Camera flashes, welcome bashes, get the matches
Toss the ashes off the ledge

As I said in my letters, now that I know better
I will never lose my baby again



My friends tried, but I wouldn't hear it
Watch me daily disappearing
For just one glimpse of his smile

All those nights, he kept me goin'
Swirled you into all of my poems

Now we're at the starting line, I did my time



Now, pretty baby, I'm runnin'



To the house where you still wait up and that porch light gleams (Gleams)

To the one who says I'm the girl of his American dreams

And no matter what I've done, it wouldn't matter anyway
Ain't no way I'm gonna screw up now that I know what's at stake here

At the park where we used to sit on children's swings

Wearing imaginary rings


But it's gonna be alright, I did my time"

He sent me ""Downtown Lights""
I hadn't heard it in a while
My boredom's bone-deep
This cage was once just fine
Am I allowed to cry?
I dream of crackin' locks
Throwin' my life to the wolves or the ocean rocks
Crashin' into him tonight, he's a paradox
I'm seeing visions
Am I bad or mad or wise?


What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?


I keep these longings lockеd
In lowercase, inside a vault
Somеone told me, ""There's no such thing as bad thoughts
Only your actions talk""
These fatal fantasies
Giving way to labored breath, takin' all of me
We've already done it in my head
If it's make-believe
Why does it feel like a vow we'll both uphold somehow?



What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
My bed sheets are ablaze
I've screamed his name
Buildin' up like waves crashin' over my grave
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?


What if I roll the stone away?
They're gonna crucify me anyway
What if the way you hold me is actually what's holy?
If long-suffering propriety is what they want from me
They don't know how you've haunted me so stunningly
I choose you and me religiously


What if he's written ""mine"" on my upper thigh only in my mind?
One slip and fallin' back into the hedge maze
Oh, what a way to die
I keep recalling things we never did
Messy top-lip kiss, how I long for our trysts
Without ever touchin' his skin
How can I be guilty as sin?

Um, this is called ""Who's Afraid of Little Old Me?""


The who's who of ""Who's that?"" is poised for the attack
But my bare hands paved their paths
You don't get to tell me about ""sad""


Ooh-ooh-ooh
If you wanted me dead, you should've just said
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Nothing makes me feel more alive


So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
You should be


The scandal was contained
The bullet had just grazed
At all costs, keep your good name
You don't get to tell me that I'm bad




Ooh-ooh-ooh
Is it a wonder I brokе? Let's hear one morе joke
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Then we could all just laugh until I cry


So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til the circus life made me mean

""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?
You should be


You should be, you should be
You should be, you should be, you should be


So tell me everything is not about me
But what if it is?
And say they didn't do it to hurt me
But what if they did?
I wanna snarl and show you just how disturbed this has made me
You wouldn't last an hour in the asylum where they raised me

So all you kids can sneak into my house with all the cobwebs
I'm always drunk on my own tears, isn't that what they all said?
That I'll sue you if you step on my lawn
That I'm fearsome and I'm wretched and I'm wrong
Put narcotics into all of my songs
And that's why you're still singin' along



So I leap from the gallows and I levitate down your street
Crash the party like a record scratch as I scream
""Who's afraid of little old me?""
I was tame, I was gentle 'til your circus life made me mean

""Don't you worry, folks, we took out all her teeth""
Who's afraid of little old me?
Well, you should be


You should be, you should be
'Cause you lured me
And you hurt me
And you taught me


You caged me and you called me crazy
I am what I am, well, 'cause you trained me
So who's afraid of me?
Who's afraid of little old me?
Who's afraid of little old me?

For the most part that was almost, sort of, almost what it should be. I'm gonna work on the melodies and the bridge so they don't become repetitive like that. But that's just the like framework and I might take some things out, but. Yeah, just a song about being crazy"

But your good Lord doesn't need to lift a finger

I can fix him, no, really, I can
And only I can



The dopamine races through his brain
On a six-lane Texas highway

His hand so calloused from his pistol
Softly traces hearts on my face

And I could see it from a mile away
A perfect case for my certain skill set

He had a halo of the highest gradе
He just hadn't met me yеt

Gazing at me starry-eyed

In your Jehovah's Witness suit

Who the fuck was that guy?
You tried to buy some pills
From a friend of friends of mine

They just ghosted you
Now you know what it feels like


And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal

And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?



You hung me on your wall
Stabbed me with your push pins

In public, showed me off

Then sank in stoned oblivion

'Cause once your queen had come

You'd treat her likе an also-ran

You didn't measure up
In any measurе of a man




And I don't even want you back, I just want to know
If rusting my sparkling summer was the goal
And I don't miss what we had, but could someone give
A message to the smallest man who ever lived?


Were you sent by someone who wanted me dead?
Did you sleep with a gun underneath our bed?
Were you writin' a book? Were you a sleeper cell spy?

In fifty years, will all this be declassified?

And you'll confess why you did it and I'll say, ""Good riddance""
'Cause it wasn't sexy once it wasn't forbidden

I would've died for your sins, instead, I just died inside

And you deserve prison
, but you won't get time

You'll slide into inboxes and slip through the bars

You crashed my party and your rental car

You said normal girls were boring
But you were gone by the morning
You kicked out the stage lights, but you're still performing



And in plain sight you hid
But you are what you did

And I'll forget you, but I'll never forgive
