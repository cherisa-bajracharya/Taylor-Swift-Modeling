    st.subheader("Why knowing each song's vibe matters?")
    st.write("Taylor Swift's music has a wide range of emotions and themes. By categorizing her songs into topics, we can better understand the emotional landscape of her discography. As fans we know how much her songwriting means to us, but as marketers we also see how much she is benifitting out of the lores in her albums and how they are resonating with different audiences.")
